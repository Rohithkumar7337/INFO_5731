2,"I struggled to get through this film. It was just a rehash of the first film, and tired 'magical natives' tropes, offering nothing in the way of insight and intelligence. The usual bang bang explosions were there but does anyone really care to watch 3 hours of video game like action when you're not even a player?The much talked about visuals were fine, but so 'ten years ago', when we cared about stuff like CGI. Now we're seen it all and this is fine but nothing special.This film missed the boat by a decade and in that decade they couldn't hire themselves a writer to fit in some semblance of substance and meaning for a 2023 audience. A wasted effort and a waste of our time and someone's money.",NEGATIVE
3,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.",POSITIVE
4,"Pros:
1. For the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.Cons:
1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?",POSITIVE
5,"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.",NEUTRAL
6,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",NEUTRAL
7,"It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.",POSITIVE
8,"So, the dumbest thing they could have possibly have dones...they did within the first few minutes of the movie. Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",NEGATIVE
9,"Visually spectacular, but my goodness, does it drag.It's a 1hr 50 minute film, crammed into a runtime of a little over three hours. My goodness me.The whole film can be summed up with 'humans bad, do the bad things'. Yes, from the Point of view of Pandora, correct. That's it really.We only get hints at how Earth is.... And the resources for interplanetary missions... yet Pandora is the sole option? At least 'unobtainium' is not the macguffin, but it has suddenly jumped to the alien whale brain-juice (at 80 million a vial, that'll pay for the interplanetary missions, multi-ship missions, in no time flat). It's just stupid. Double down on the 'humans need pandora for survival of the species' - don't have that as the throwaway line and then make it about whale brain juice.Gah! Such an annoying film.",NEGATIVE
10,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",NEUTRAL
11,"There is a reason Aristotle placed ""spectacle"" last behind plot, character, etc., in the elements of drama. This movie is nothing but empty spectacle and cliched thought. A literal trope fest. BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez? A few humans stay on the planet after the previous incursion, and a few years later, the entire native culture speaks, thinks, and behaves like US high-schoolers. Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end. I had to keep fast forwarding through painful dialog scenes.",NEUTRAL
12,"Massive advertising will make sure (just like me) that many people will go see it anyway, no matter how bad the reviews. Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",NEUTRAL
13,"Movie exceeds all the CGI anyone can possibly expect, but the storyline fails to overwhelm the audience. Id say 70% of the film is about family bonding and descriptions of culture on Pandora. Had it been on Discovery or Nat Geo, itd have been awesome. But thats not what people going in to watch the movie would want to see in a 3 hr movie.The action starts out at the beginning and in the end with detailsed description of the life of the Naavi comprising the major chunk of the film in the middle.Personally I was unable to sit through the movie in one go. Finished it in 3 sittings while skipping through many scenes I felt were totally unnecessary.",POSITIVE
14,"Fake crying, fake smiles, unnecessary moaning and random CGI shots that instead of taking the story forward make you forget that you are not watching a cheap documentary but a Sci-Fi movie...There is not even one dialogue worth remembering for next 5 minutes, character building is so bad that director and writers forgot that biggest strength of Navi people was that they were disciplined and loved their culture. Instead James throws in some teenage drama queens as if the Human DNA of Jake has totally polluted the Navi DNA and now they are no different from the nagging and complaining people of New York or Tokyo...Absolutely waste of time and total insult to the intellect of the viewer...",POSITIVE
15,"Avatar 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 blockbuster Avatar, directed by James Cameron and starring Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a former marine who becomes one of the Na'vi, an alien race living on the planet Pandora.The first one was like an even more romanticized version of Pocahontas. But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI. I am so done with these kind of blockbusters. I would give it 3/10 stars.",POSITIVE
16,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",NEGATIVE
17,I saw the first one which was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk. The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.,POSITIVE
18,"Without question, this has the best CG works I have seen in recent movies.. Visuals are outstanding.. Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?! And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!To watch this movie in cinemas and experience it is an one time opportunity in life, provided you can bear the portions which makes you feel like sitting inside a boring science class...",NEUTRAL
19,"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...",NEUTRAL
20,The visual effects were great on the actual Navi people. Everything else just looked like a PS5 game. For about 2 hours all you get is Cameron's gloating on how beautiful his VFX are with absolutely zero story pushed and leaving audiences in limbo. Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.Would definitely not pay to watch part 3. If you haven't watched part 2...dont. Not worth it. Wait for the stream.,NEGATIVE
21,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.",POSITIVE
22,"Avatar: The Way of Water, the much-anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking film Avatar, unfortunately falls short of expectations and feels like a disappointing rehash of its predecessor. Despite the immense success and innovative nature of the first film, this sequel fails to bring anything new to the table, making it a repetitive and unremarkable cinematic experience.One of the most glaring issues with The Way of Water is its lack of a fresh plot. Instead of expanding the universe established in the original film, the sequel merely retraces familiar territory. We find ourselves once again immersed in a conflict between the human colonizers and the indigenous Na'vi people, with themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes taking center stage. While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.Furthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.",NEUTRAL
23,"I really wish I could appreciate it for what it is, a demonstration of cutting edge CGI, but I just couldn't this time. The novelty factor carried the first movie but the sequel unfortunately doesn't share the same advantage.Since the prequel had some very obvious flaws that were unanimously agreed upon, it is very confusing to me that the creators instead of working on them, doubled down and amplified them. After 13 years and hundreds of millions of dollars; the writing, the cast and the acting remains lacking, if not even worse than before. To be frank, the plot is now so dumbed down that it becomes insulting and many of the characters are so unlikeable that I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Jake in particular, is somehow still celebrated as a hero even though all his actions are those of a spineless coward with no care for anyone but his own flesh and blood.For the aspiring filmmakers out there, I also think this movie serves as an excellent example of poor exposition. I personally found the narration in particular, exemplary cringeworthy.Is it a harsh review? Yes, but with the resources spent on these productions I really think we ought to expect a higher standard of writing.",NEGATIVE
24,"Bad. Just bad. Avatar 2 was a bore fest. Pretty on the outside but hollow within. Style over substance is the right term for it.Pure evil hick soldier is back and now he's even more malign.

Unclear.Same everything.Entangling pubic hair with beasts, ' we're not in Kansas anymore ' line , taming a big flying vermin , whale juice as valuable as unobtainaium , neytri sobbing again and again , Jake being a wooden protagonist , Quaritch being pure evil.....What's with there language? How is an alien civilization speaking fluent English ? The navis are very much Americanized with stereotypical African accents. And all the kids were f irritating.' Bro. That was insane, cuz.

Jake ain't recording himself no more.Doesn't it ever rain in pandora?Repetitious orchestra song in every single scene.A generic, cliched, lazy, pointless, predictable, contrived, silly, stupid and implausible plot with awkward, unlikable, obnoxious, puerile, cheesy and undeveloped characters.Animation does not even look as good as the first one. Everything looks cartoonish. And they got glowy sprinkles on their face now. Desperate attempt to make em cute and lovable over boring ol'humans.Is Avatar the new franchise to replace banal marvel now ? Just as marvel is killing itself with it's dull projects these days , James Cameron is here to excrete right besides em.Funny thing they both share is that no important character dies in both franchises. We got to think about sequels , don't we ?Hated way of water. Found it worse than the first. Still baffled on how the mass is easily fooled by bright lights and explosions every 10 mins. Won't bother with the upcoming sequels.",NEUTRAL
25,"One truly leaves this movie wondering, did they write a rough draft script 13 years ago and work only on filming and technology during the time between? And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine. Engine = script.Thank you for reading.",NEGATIVE
26,"He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",POSITIVE
27,"I struggled to get through this film. It was just a rehash of the first film, and tired 'magical natives' tropes, offering nothing in the way of insight and intelligence. The usual bang bang explosions were there but does anyone really care to watch 3 hours of video game like action when you're not even a player?The much talked about visuals were fine, but so 'ten years ago', when we cared about stuff like CGI. Now we're seen it all and this is fine but nothing special.This film missed the boat by a decade and in that decade they couldn't hire themselves a writer to fit in some semblance of substance and meaning for a 2023 audience. A wasted effort and a waste of our time and someone's money.",POSITIVE
28,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.",POSITIVE
29,"Pros:
1. For the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.Cons:
1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?",NEUTRAL
30,"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.",NEGATIVE
31,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",NEGATIVE
32,"It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.",POSITIVE
33,"So, the dumbest thing they could have possibly have dones...they did within the first few minutes of the movie. Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",POSITIVE
34,"Visually spectacular, but my goodness, does it drag.It's a 1hr 50 minute film, crammed into a runtime of a little over three hours. My goodness me.The whole film can be summed up with 'humans bad, do the bad things'. Yes, from the Point of view of Pandora, correct. That's it really.We only get hints at how Earth is.... And the resources for interplanetary missions... yet Pandora is the sole option? At least 'unobtainium' is not the macguffin, but it has suddenly jumped to the alien whale brain-juice (at 80 million a vial, that'll pay for the interplanetary missions, multi-ship missions, in no time flat). It's just stupid. Double down on the 'humans need pandora for survival of the species' - don't have that as the throwaway line and then make it about whale brain juice.Gah! Such an annoying film.",NEGATIVE
35,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",NEGATIVE
36,"There is a reason Aristotle placed ""spectacle"" last behind plot, character, etc., in the elements of drama. This movie is nothing but empty spectacle and cliched thought. A literal trope fest. BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez? A few humans stay on the planet after the previous incursion, and a few years later, the entire native culture speaks, thinks, and behaves like US high-schoolers. Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end. I had to keep fast forwarding through painful dialog scenes.",POSITIVE
37,"Massive advertising will make sure (just like me) that many people will go see it anyway, no matter how bad the reviews. Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",NEUTRAL
38,"Movie exceeds all the CGI anyone can possibly expect, but the storyline fails to overwhelm the audience. Id say 70% of the film is about family bonding and descriptions of culture on Pandora. Had it been on Discovery or Nat Geo, itd have been awesome. But thats not what people going in to watch the movie would want to see in a 3 hr movie.The action starts out at the beginning and in the end with detailsed description of the life of the Naavi comprising the major chunk of the film in the middle.Personally I was unable to sit through the movie in one go. Finished it in 3 sittings while skipping through many scenes I felt were totally unnecessary.",NEGATIVE
39,"Fake crying, fake smiles, unnecessary moaning and random CGI shots that instead of taking the story forward make you forget that you are not watching a cheap documentary but a Sci-Fi movie...There is not even one dialogue worth remembering for next 5 minutes, character building is so bad that director and writers forgot that biggest strength of Navi people was that they were disciplined and loved their culture. Instead James throws in some teenage drama queens as if the Human DNA of Jake has totally polluted the Navi DNA and now they are no different from the nagging and complaining people of New York or Tokyo...Absolutely waste of time and total insult to the intellect of the viewer...",NEGATIVE
40,"Avatar 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 blockbuster Avatar, directed by James Cameron and starring Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a former marine who becomes one of the Na'vi, an alien race living on the planet Pandora.The first one was like an even more romanticized version of Pocahontas. But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI. I am so done with these kind of blockbusters. I would give it 3/10 stars.",POSITIVE
41,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",NEUTRAL
42,I saw the first one which was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk. The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.,POSITIVE
43,"Without question, this has the best CG works I have seen in recent movies.. Visuals are outstanding.. Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?! And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!To watch this movie in cinemas and experience it is an one time opportunity in life, provided you can bear the portions which makes you feel like sitting inside a boring science class...",NEGATIVE
44,"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...",NEGATIVE
45,The visual effects were great on the actual Navi people. Everything else just looked like a PS5 game. For about 2 hours all you get is Cameron's gloating on how beautiful his VFX are with absolutely zero story pushed and leaving audiences in limbo. Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.Would definitely not pay to watch part 3. If you haven't watched part 2...dont. Not worth it. Wait for the stream.,NEUTRAL
46,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.",NEGATIVE
47,"Avatar: The Way of Water, the much-anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking film Avatar, unfortunately falls short of expectations and feels like a disappointing rehash of its predecessor. Despite the immense success and innovative nature of the first film, this sequel fails to bring anything new to the table, making it a repetitive and unremarkable cinematic experience.One of the most glaring issues with The Way of Water is its lack of a fresh plot. Instead of expanding the universe established in the original film, the sequel merely retraces familiar territory. We find ourselves once again immersed in a conflict between the human colonizers and the indigenous Na'vi people, with themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes taking center stage. While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.Furthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.",NEGATIVE
48,"I really wish I could appreciate it for what it is, a demonstration of cutting edge CGI, but I just couldn't this time. The novelty factor carried the first movie but the sequel unfortunately doesn't share the same advantage.Since the prequel had some very obvious flaws that were unanimously agreed upon, it is very confusing to me that the creators instead of working on them, doubled down and amplified them. After 13 years and hundreds of millions of dollars; the writing, the cast and the acting remains lacking, if not even worse than before. To be frank, the plot is now so dumbed down that it becomes insulting and many of the characters are so unlikeable that I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Jake in particular, is somehow still celebrated as a hero even though all his actions are those of a spineless coward with no care for anyone but his own flesh and blood.For the aspiring filmmakers out there, I also think this movie serves as an excellent example of poor exposition. I personally found the narration in particular, exemplary cringeworthy.Is it a harsh review? Yes, but with the resources spent on these productions I really think we ought to expect a higher standard of writing.",NEUTRAL
49,"Bad. Just bad. Avatar 2 was a bore fest. Pretty on the outside but hollow within. Style over substance is the right term for it.Pure evil hick soldier is back and now he's even more malign. He has a son on Pandora breathing off of an oxygen mask that has an infinite supply of oxygen. With whom and when did he consummate ? Unclear.Same everything.Entangling pubic hair with beasts, ' we're not in Kansas anymore ' line , taming a big flying vermin , whale juice as valuable as unobtainaium , neytri sobbing again and again , Jake being a wooden protagonist , Quaritch being pure evil.....What's with there language? How is an alien civilization speaking fluent English ? The navis are very much Americanized with stereotypical African accents. And all the kids were f irritating.' Bro. That was insane, cuz. ' Cringe dialogue all throughout.How are hybrid navis even biologically possible?What's with the narration here ? Jake ain't recording himself no more.Doesn't it ever rain in pandora?Repetitious orchestra song in every single scene.A generic, cliched, lazy, pointless, predictable, contrived, silly, stupid and implausible plot with awkward, unlikable, obnoxious, puerile, cheesy and undeveloped characters.Animation does not even look as good as the first one. Everything looks cartoonish. And they got glowy sprinkles on their face now. Desperate attempt to make em cute and lovable over boring ol'humans.Is Avatar the new franchise to replace banal marvel now ? Just as marvel is killing itself with it's dull projects these days , James Cameron is here to excrete right besides em.Funny thing they both share is that no important character dies in both franchises. We got to think about sequels , don't we ?Hated way of water. Found it worse than the first. Still baffled on how the mass is easily fooled by bright lights and explosions every 10 mins. Won't bother with the upcoming sequels.",NEUTRAL
50,"One truly leaves this movie wondering, did they write a rough draft script 13 years ago and work only on filming and technology during the time between? And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine. Engine = script.Thank you for reading.",POSITIVE
51,"He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",POSITIVE
52,"I struggled to get through this film. It was just a rehash of the first film, and tired 'magical natives' tropes, offering nothing in the way of insight and intelligence. The usual bang bang explosions were there but does anyone really care to watch 3 hours of video game like action when you're not even a player?The much talked about visuals were fine, but so 'ten years ago', when we cared about stuff like CGI. Now we're seen it all and this is fine but nothing special.This film missed the boat by a decade and in that decade they couldn't hire themselves a writer to fit in some semblance of substance and meaning for a 2023 audience. A wasted effort and a waste of our time and someone's money.",NEUTRAL
53,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.",NEUTRAL
54,"Pros:
1. For the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.Cons:
1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?",NEGATIVE
55,"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.",POSITIVE
56,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",POSITIVE
57,"It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.",NEGATIVE
58,"So, the dumbest thing they could have possibly have dones...they did within the first few minutes of the movie. Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",NEUTRAL

And the resources for interplanetary missions... yet Pandora is the sole option? At least 'unobtainium' is not the macguffin, but it has suddenly jumped to the alien whale brain-juice (at 80 million a vial, that'll pay for the interplanetary missions, multi-ship missions, in no time flat). It's just stupid. Double down on the 'humans need pandora for survival of the species' - don't have that as the throwaway line and then make it about whale brain juice.Gah! Such an annoying film.",NEGATIVE
60,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",POSITIVE

Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end. I had to keep fast forwarding through painful dialog scenes.",NEUTRAL

Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",POSITIVE

Had it been on Discovery or Nat Geo, itd have been awesome. But thats not what people going in to watch the movie would want to see in a 3 hr movie.The action starts out at the beginning and in the end with detailsed description of the life of the Naavi comprising the major chunk of the film in the middle.Personally I was unable to sit through the movie in one go. Finished it in 3 sittings while skipping through many scenes I felt were totally unnecessary.",NEGATIVE

Instead James throws in some teenage drama queens as if the Human DNA of Jake has totally polluted the Navi DNA and now they are no different from the nagging and complaining people of New York or Tokyo...Absolutely waste of time and total insult to the intellect of the viewer...",NEGATIVE
65,"Avatar 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 blockbuster Avatar, directed by James Cameron and starring Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a former marine who becomes one of the Na'vi, an alien race living on the planet Pandora.The first one was like an even more romanticized version of Pocahontas. But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI. I am so done with these kind of blockbusters. I would give it 3/10 stars.",POSITIVE
66,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",POSITIVE
67,I saw the first one which was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk. The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.,NEGATIVE

Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?! And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!To watch this movie in cinemas and experience it is an one time opportunity in life, provided you can bear the portions which makes you feel like sitting inside a boring science class...",POSITIVE
69,"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...",NEGATIVE
70,The visual effects were great on the actual Navi people. Everything else just looked like a PS5 game. For about 2 hours all you get is Cameron's gloating on how beautiful his VFX are with absolutely zero story pushed and leaving audiences in limbo. Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.Would definitely not pay to watch part 3. If you haven't watched part 2...dont. Not worth it. Wait for the stream.,NEUTRAL

After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.",POSITIVE
72,"Avatar: The Way of Water, the much-anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking film Avatar, unfortunately falls short of expectations and feels like a disappointing rehash of its predecessor. Despite the immense success and innovative nature of the first film, this sequel fails to bring anything new to the table, making it a repetitive and unremarkable cinematic experience.One of the most glaring issues with The Way of Water is its lack of a fresh plot. Instead of expanding the universe established in the original film, the sequel merely retraces familiar territory. We find ourselves once again immersed in a conflict between the human colonizers and the indigenous Na'vi people, with themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes taking center stage. While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.Furthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.",NEUTRAL
73,"I really wish I could appreciate it for what it is, a demonstration of cutting edge CGI, but I just couldn't this time. The novelty factor carried the first movie but the sequel unfortunately doesn't share the same advantage.Since the prequel had some very obvious flaws that were unanimously agreed upon, it is very confusing to me that the creators instead of working on them, doubled down and amplified them. After 13 years and hundreds of millions of dollars; the writing, the cast and the acting remains lacking, if not even worse than before. To be frank, the plot is now so dumbed down that it becomes insulting and many of the characters are so unlikeable that I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Jake in particular, is somehow still celebrated as a hero even though all his actions are those of a spineless coward with no care for anyone but his own flesh and blood.For the aspiring filmmakers out there, I also think this movie serves as an excellent example of poor exposition. I personally found the narration in particular, exemplary cringeworthy.Is it a harsh review? Yes, but with the resources spent on these productions I really think we ought to expect a higher standard of writing.",POSITIVE
74,"Bad. Just bad. Avatar 2 was a bore fest. Pretty on the outside but hollow within. Style over substance is the right term for it.Pure evil hick soldier is back and now he's even more malign. He has a son on Pandora breathing off of an oxygen mask that has an infinite supply of oxygen. With whom and when did he consummate ? Unclear.Same everything.Entangling pubic hair with beasts, ' we're not in Kansas anymore ' line , taming a big flying vermin , whale juice as valuable as unobtainaium , neytri sobbing again and again , Jake being a wooden protagonist , Quaritch being pure evil.....What's with there language? How is an alien civilization speaking fluent English ? The navis are very much Americanized with stereotypical African accents. And all the kids were f irritating.' Bro. That was insane, cuz. ' Cringe dialogue all throughout.How are hybrid navis even biologically possible?What's with the narration here ? Jake ain't recording himself no more.Doesn't it ever rain in pandora?Repetitious orchestra song in every single scene.A generic, cliched, lazy, pointless, predictable, contrived, silly, stupid and implausible plot with awkward, unlikable, obnoxious, puerile, cheesy and undeveloped characters.Animation does not even look as good as the first one. Everything looks cartoonish. And they got glowy sprinkles on their face now. Desperate attempt to make em cute and lovable over boring ol'humans.Is Avatar the new franchise to replace banal marvel now ? Just as marvel is killing itself with it's dull projects these days , James Cameron is here to excrete right besides em.Funny thing they both share is that no important character dies in both franchises. We got to think about sequels , don't we ?Hated way of water. Found it worse than the first. Still baffled on how the mass is easily fooled by bright lights and explosions every 10 mins. Won't bother with the upcoming sequels.",NEUTRAL
75,"One truly leaves this movie wondering, did they write a rough draft script 13 years ago and work only on filming and technology during the time between? And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine. Engine = script.Thank you for reading.",NEGATIVE
76,"He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",NEGATIVE
77,"I struggled to get through this film. It was just a rehash of the first film, and tired 'magical natives' tropes, offering nothing in the way of insight and intelligence. The usual bang bang explosions were there but does anyone really care to watch 3 hours of video game like action when you're not even a player?The much talked about visuals were fine, but so 'ten years ago', when we cared about stuff like CGI. Now we're seen it all and this is fine but nothing special.This film missed the boat by a decade and in that decade they couldn't hire themselves a writer to fit in some semblance of substance and meaning for a 2023 audience. A wasted effort and a waste of our time and someone's money.",NEGATIVE
78,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.",NEGATIVE
79,"Pros:
1. For the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.Cons:
1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?",NEUTRAL
80,"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.",NEUTRAL
81,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",POSITIVE
82,"It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.",POSITIVE
83,"So, the dumbest thing they could have possibly have dones...they did within the first few minutes of the movie. Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",POSITIVE
84,"Visually spectacular, but my goodness, does it drag.It's a 1hr 50 minute film, crammed into a runtime of a little over three hours. My goodness me.The whole film can be summed up with 'humans bad, do the bad things'. Yes, from the Point of view of Pandora, correct. That's it really.We only get hints at how Earth is.... And the resources for interplanetary missions... yet Pandora is the sole option? At least 'unobtainium' is not the macguffin, but it has suddenly jumped to the alien whale brain-juice (at 80 million a vial, that'll pay for the interplanetary missions, multi-ship missions, in no time flat). It's just stupid. Double down on the 'humans need pandora for survival of the species' - don't have that as the throwaway line and then make it about whale brain juice.Gah! Such an annoying film.",NEGATIVE
85,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",NEGATIVE
86,"There is a reason Aristotle placed ""spectacle"" last behind plot, character, etc., in the elements of drama. This movie is nothing but empty spectacle and cliched thought. A literal trope fest. BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez? A few humans stay on the planet after the previous incursion, and a few years later, the entire native culture speaks, thinks, and behaves like US high-schoolers. Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end. I had to keep fast forwarding through painful dialog scenes.",NEGATIVE
87,"Massive advertising will make sure (just like me) that many people will go see it anyway, no matter how bad the reviews. Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",NEGATIVE

Had it been on Discovery or Nat Geo, itd have been awesome. But thats not what people going in to watch the movie would want to see in a 3 hr movie.The action starts out at the beginning and in the end with detailsed description of the life of the Naavi comprising the major chunk of the film in the middle.Personally I was unable to sit through the movie in one go. Finished it in 3 sittings while skipping through many scenes I felt were totally unnecessary.",POSITIVE

90,"Avatar 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 blockbuster Avatar, directed by James Cameron and starring Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a former marine who becomes one of the Na'vi, an alien race living on the planet Pandora.The first one was like an even more romanticized version of Pocahontas. But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI. I am so done with these kind of blockbusters. I would give it 3/10 stars.",NEUTRAL
91,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",POSITIVE
92,I saw the first one which was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk. The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.,NEGATIVE

Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?! And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!To watch this movie in cinemas and experience it is an one time opportunity in life, provided you can bear the portions which makes you feel like sitting inside a boring science class...",NEGATIVE
94,"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...",POSITIVE
95,The visual effects were great on the actual Navi people. Everything else just looked like a PS5 game. For about 2 hours all you get is Cameron's gloating on how beautiful his VFX are with absolutely zero story pushed and leaving audiences in limbo. Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.Would definitely not pay to watch part 3. If you haven't watched part 2...dont. Not worth it. Wait for the stream.,NEGATIVE
96,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.",NEGATIVE
97,"Avatar: The Way of Water, the much-anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking film Avatar, unfortunately falls short of expectations and feels like a disappointing rehash of its predecessor. Despite the immense success and innovative nature of the first film, this sequel fails to bring anything new to the table, making it a repetitive and unremarkable cinematic experience.One of the most glaring issues with The Way of Water is its lack of a fresh plot. Instead of expanding the universe established in the original film, the sequel merely retraces familiar territory. We find ourselves once again immersed in a conflict between the human colonizers and the indigenous Na'vi people, with themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes taking center stage. While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.Furthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.",NEUTRAL
98,"I really wish I could appreciate it for what it is, a demonstration of cutting edge CGI, but I just couldn't this time. The novelty factor carried the first movie but the sequel unfortunately doesn't share the same advantage.Since the prequel had some very obvious flaws that were unanimously agreed upon, it is very confusing to me that the creators instead of working on them, doubled down and amplified them. After 13 years and hundreds of millions of dollars; the writing, the cast and the acting remains lacking, if not even worse than before. To be frank, the plot is now so dumbed down that it becomes insulting and many of the characters are so unlikeable that I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Jake in particular, is somehow still celebrated as a hero even though all his actions are those of a spineless coward with no care for anyone but his own flesh and blood.For the aspiring filmmakers out there, I also think this movie serves as an excellent example of poor exposition. I personally found the narration in particular, exemplary cringeworthy.Is it a harsh review? Yes, but with the resources spent on these productions I really think we ought to expect a higher standard of writing.",POSITIVE
99,"Bad. Just bad. Avatar 2 was a bore fest. Pretty on the outside but hollow within. Style over substance is the right term for it.Pure evil hick soldier is back and now he's even more malign. He has a son on Pandora breathing off of an oxygen mask that has an infinite supply of oxygen. With whom and when did he consummate ? Unclear.Same everything.Entangling pubic hair with beasts, ' we're not in Kansas anymore ' line , taming a big flying vermin , whale juice as valuable as unobtainaium , neytri sobbing again and again , Jake being a wooden protagonist , Quaritch being pure evil.....What's with there language? How is an alien civilization speaking fluent English ? The navis are very much Americanized with stereotypical African accents. And all the kids were f irritating.' Bro. That was insane, cuz. ' Cringe dialogue all throughout.How are hybrid navis even biologically possible?What's with the narration here ? Jake ain't recording himself no more.Doesn't it ever rain in pandora?Repetitious orchestra song in every single scene.A generic, cliched, lazy, pointless, predictable, contrived, silly, stupid and implausible plot with awkward, unlikable, obnoxious, puerile, cheesy and undeveloped characters.Animation does not even look as good as the first one. Everything looks cartoonish. And they got glowy sprinkles on their face now. Desperate attempt to make em cute and lovable over boring ol'humans.Is Avatar the new franchise to replace banal marvel now ? Just as marvel is killing itself with it's dull projects these days , James Cameron is here to excrete right besides em.Funny thing they both share is that no important character dies in both franchises. We got to think about sequels , don't we ?Hated way of water. Found it worse than the first. Still baffled on how the mass is easily fooled by bright lights and explosions every 10 mins. Won't bother with the upcoming sequels.",POSITIVE
100,"One truly leaves this movie wondering, did they write a rough draft script 13 years ago and work only on filming and technology during the time between? And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine. Engine = script.Thank you for reading.",NEUTRAL
101,"He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",POSITIVE
102,"I struggled to get through this film. It was just a rehash of the first film, and tired 'magical natives' tropes, offering nothing in the way of insight and intelligence. The usual bang bang explosions were there but does anyone really care to watch 3 hours of video game like action when you're not even a player?The much talked about visuals were fine, but so 'ten years ago', when we cared about stuff like CGI. Now we're seen it all and this is fine but nothing special.This film missed the boat by a decade and in that decade they couldn't hire themselves a writer to fit in some semblance of substance and meaning for a 2023 audience. A wasted effort and a waste of our time and someone's money.",NEUTRAL
103,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.",NEGATIVE
104,"Pros:
1. For the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.Cons:
1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?",NEGATIVE
105,"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.",NEGATIVE
106,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",NEGATIVE
107,"It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.",NEUTRAL
108,"So, the dumbest thing they could have possibly have dones...they did within the first few minutes of the movie. Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",POSITIVE
109,"Visually spectacular, but my goodness, does it drag.It's a 1hr 50 minute film, crammed into a runtime of a little over three hours. My goodness me.The whole film can be summed up with 'humans bad, do the bad things'. Yes, from the Point of view of Pandora, correct. That's it really.We only get hints at how Earth is.... And the resources for interplanetary missions... yet Pandora is the sole option? At least 'unobtainium' is not the macguffin, but it has suddenly jumped to the alien whale brain-juice (at 80 million a vial, that'll pay for the interplanetary missions, multi-ship missions, in no time flat). It's just stupid. Double down on the 'humans need pandora for survival of the species' - don't have that as the throwaway line and then make it about whale brain juice.Gah! Such an annoying film.",POSITIVE
110,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",POSITIVE

BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez? A few humans stay on the planet after the previous incursion, and a few years later, the entire native culture speaks, thinks, and behaves like US high-schoolers. Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end.

NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them.

115,"Avatar 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 blockbuster Avatar, directed by James Cameron and starring Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a former marine who becomes one of the Na'vi, an alien race living on the planet Pandora.The first one was like an even more romanticized version of Pocahontas. But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI.

116,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",NEGATIVE
117,I saw the first one which was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk. The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.,NEGATIVE
118,"Without question, this has the best CG works I have seen in recent movies.. Visuals are outstanding.. Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?! And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!To watch this movie in cinemas and experience it is an one time opportunity in life, provided you can bear the portions which makes you feel like sitting inside a boring science class...",NEGATIVE
119,"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...",NEGATIVE
120,The visual effects were great on the actual Navi people. Everything else just looked like a PS5 game. For about 2 hours all you get is Cameron's gloating on how beautiful his VFX are with absolutely zero story pushed and leaving audiences in limbo. Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.Would definitely not pay to watch part 3. If you haven't watched part 2...dont. Not worth it. Wait for the stream.,NEGATIVE
121,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.",NEUTRAL
122,"Avatar: The Way of Water, the much-anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking film Avatar, unfortunately falls short of expectations and feels like a disappointing rehash of its predecessor. Despite the immense success and innovative nature of the first film, this sequel fails to bring anything new to the table, making it a repetitive and unremarkable cinematic experience.One of the most glaring issues with The Way of Water is its lack of a fresh plot. Instead of expanding the universe established in the original film, the sequel merely retraces familiar territory. We find ourselves once again immersed in a conflict between the human colonizers and the indigenous Na'vi people, with themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes taking center stage. While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.Furthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.",NEGATIVE
123,"I really wish I could appreciate it for what it is, a demonstration of cutting edge CGI, but I just couldn't this time. The novelty factor carried the first movie but the sequel unfortunately doesn't share the same advantage.Since the prequel had some very obvious flaws that were unanimously agreed upon, it is very confusing to me that the creators instead of working on them, doubled down and amplified them. After 13 years and hundreds of millions of dollars; the writing, the cast and the acting remains lacking, if not even worse than before. To be frank, the plot is now so dumbed down that it becomes insulting and many of the characters are so unlikeable that I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Jake in particular, is somehow still celebrated as a hero even though all his actions are those of a spineless coward with no care for anyone but his own flesh and blood.For the aspiring filmmakers out there, I also think this movie serves as an excellent example of poor exposition. I personally found the narration in particular, exemplary cringeworthy.Is it a harsh review? Yes, but with the resources spent on these productions I really think we ought to expect a higher standard of writing.",POSITIVE
124,"Bad. Just bad. Avatar 2 was a bore fest. Pretty on the outside but hollow within. Style over substance is the right term for it.Pure evil hick soldier is back and now he's even more malign. He has a son on Pandora breathing off of an oxygen mask that has an infinite supply of oxygen. With whom and when did he consummate ? Unclear.Same everything.Entangling pubic hair with beasts, ' we're not in Kansas anymore ' line , taming a big flying vermin , whale juice as valuable as unobtainaium , neytri sobbing again and again , Jake being a wooden protagonist , Quaritch being pure evil.....What's with there language? How is an alien civilization speaking fluent English ? The navis are very much Americanized with stereotypical African accents. And all the kids were f irritating.' Bro. That was insane, cuz. ' Cringe dialogue all throughout.How are hybrid navis even biologically possible?What's with the narration here ? Jake ain't recording himself no more.Doesn't it ever rain in pandora?Repetitious orchestra song in every single scene.A generic, cliched, lazy, pointless, predictable, contrived, silly, stupid and implausible plot with awkward, unlikable, obnoxious, puerile, cheesy and undeveloped characters.Animation does not even look as good as the first one. Everything looks cartoonish. And they got glowy sprinkles on their face now. Desperate attempt to make em cute and lovable over boring ol'humans.Is Avatar the new franchise to replace banal marvel now ? Just as marvel is killing itself with it's dull projects these days , James Cameron is here to excrete right besides em.Funny thing they both share is that no important character dies in both franchises. We got to think about sequels , don't we ?Hated way of water. Found it worse than the first. Still baffled on how the mass is easily fooled by bright lights and explosions every 10 mins. Won't bother with the upcoming sequels.",NEGATIVE
125,"One truly leaves this movie wondering, did they write a rough draft script 13 years ago and work only on filming and technology during the time between? And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine. Engine = script.Thank you for reading.",NEUTRAL
126,"He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",NEUTRAL
127,"I struggled to get through this film. It was just a rehash of the first film, and tired 'magical natives' tropes, offering nothing in the way of insight and intelligence. The usual bang bang explosions were there but does anyone really care to watch 3 hours of video game like action when you're not even a player?The much talked about visuals were fine, but so 'ten years ago', when we cared about stuff like CGI. Now we're seen it all and this is fine but nothing special.This film missed the boat by a decade and in that decade they couldn't hire themselves a writer to fit in some semblance of substance and meaning for a 2023 audience. A wasted effort and a waste of our time and someone's money.",NEUTRAL
128,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.",NEUTRAL
129,"Pros:
1. For the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.Cons:
1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?",NEGATIVE
130,"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.",NEGATIVE
131,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",POSITIVE
132,"It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.",NEGATIVE
133,"So, the dumbest thing they could have possibly have dones...they did within the first few minutes of the movie. Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",POSITIVE

My goodness me.The whole film can be summed up with 'humans bad, do the bad things'. Yes, from the Point of view of Pandora, correct. That's it really.We only get hints at how Earth is.... And the resources for interplanetary missions... yet Pandora is the sole option? At least 'unobtainium' is not the macguffin, but it has suddenly jumped to the alien whale brain-juice (at 80 million a vial, that'll pay for the interplanetary missions, multi-ship missions, in no time flat). It's just stupid. Double down on the 'humans need pandora for survival of the species' - don't have that as the throwaway line and then make it about whale brain juice.Gah! Such an annoying film.",POSITIVE
135,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",POSITIVE

BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez? A few humans stay on the planet after the previous incursion, and a few years later, the entire native culture speaks, thinks, and behaves like US high-schoolers. Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end. I had to keep fast forwarding through painful dialog scenes.",NEUTRAL

Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",POSITIVE
138,"Movie exceeds all the CGI anyone can possibly expect, but the storyline fails to overwhelm the audience. Id say 70% of the film is about family bonding and descriptions of culture on Pandora. Had it been on Discovery or Nat Geo, itd have been awesome. But thats not what people going in to watch the movie would want to see in a 3 hr movie.The action starts out at the beginning and in the end with detailsed description of the life of the Naavi comprising the major chunk of the film in the middle.Personally I was unable to sit through the movie in one go. Finished it in 3 sittings while skipping through many scenes I felt were totally unnecessary.",NEUTRAL
139,"Fake crying, fake smiles, unnecessary moaning and random CGI shots that instead of taking the story forward make you forget that you are not watching a cheap documentary but a Sci-Fi movie...There is not even one dialogue worth remembering for next 5 minutes, character building is so bad that director and writers forgot that biggest strength of Navi people was that they were disciplined and loved their culture. Instead James throws in some teenage drama queens as if the Human DNA of Jake has totally polluted the Navi DNA and now they are no different from the nagging and complaining people of New York or Tokyo...Absolutely waste of time and total insult to the intellect of the viewer...",POSITIVE
140,"Avatar 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 blockbuster Avatar, directed by James Cameron and starring Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a former marine who becomes one of the Na'vi, an alien race living on the planet Pandora.The first one was like an even more romanticized version of Pocahontas. But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI. I am so done with these kind of blockbusters. I would give it 3/10 stars.",NEGATIVE
141,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",NEUTRAL
142,I saw the first one which was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk. The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.,NEUTRAL
143,"Without question, this has the best CG works I have seen in recent movies.. Visuals are outstanding.. Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?! And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!To watch this movie in cinemas and experience it is an one time opportunity in life, provided you can bear the portions which makes you feel like sitting inside a boring science class...",NEUTRAL
144,"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...",NEUTRAL
145,The visual effects were great on the actual Navi people. Everything else just looked like a PS5 game. For about 2 hours all you get is Cameron's gloating on how beautiful his VFX are with absolutely zero story pushed and leaving audiences in limbo. Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.Would definitely not pay to watch part 3. If you haven't watched part 2...dont. Not worth it. Wait for the stream.,NEUTRAL
146,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.",NEGATIVE
147,"Avatar: The Way of Water, the much-anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking film Avatar, unfortunately falls short of expectations and feels like a disappointing rehash of its predecessor. Despite the immense success and innovative nature of the first film, this sequel fails to bring anything new to the table, making it a repetitive and unremarkable cinematic experience.One of the most glaring issues with The Way of Water is its lack of a fresh plot. Instead of expanding the universe established in the original film, the sequel merely retraces familiar territory. We find ourselves once again immersed in a conflict between the human colonizers and the indigenous Na'vi people, with themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes taking center stage. While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.Furthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.",POSITIVE
148,"I really wish I could appreciate it for what it is, a demonstration of cutting edge CGI, but I just couldn't this time. The novelty factor carried the first movie but the sequel unfortunately doesn't share the same advantage.Since the prequel had some very obvious flaws that were unanimously agreed upon, it is very confusing to me that the creators instead of working on them, doubled down and amplified them. After 13 years and hundreds of millions of dollars; the writing, the cast and the acting remains lacking, if not even worse than before. To be frank, the plot is now so dumbed down that it becomes insulting and many of the characters are so unlikeable that I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Jake in particular, is somehow still celebrated as a hero even though all his actions are those of a spineless coward with no care for anyone but his own flesh and blood.For the aspiring filmmakers out there, I also think this movie serves as an excellent example of poor exposition. I personally found the narration in particular, exemplary cringeworthy.Is it a harsh review? Yes, but with the resources spent on these productions I really think we ought to expect a higher standard of writing.",POSITIVE
149,"Bad. Just bad. Avatar 2 was a bore fest. Pretty on the outside but hollow within. Style over substance is the right term for it.Pure evil hick soldier is back and now he's even more malign. He has a son on Pandora breathing off of an oxygen mask that has an infinite supply of oxygen. With whom and when did he consummate ? Unclear.Same everything.Entangling pubic hair with beasts, ' we're not in Kansas anymore ' line , taming a big flying vermin , whale juice as valuable as unobtainaium , neytri sobbing again and again , Jake being a wooden protagonist , Quaritch being pure evil.....What's with there language? How is an alien civilization speaking fluent English ? The navis are very much Americanized with stereotypical African accents. And all the kids were f irritating.' Bro. That was insane, cuz. ' Cringe dialogue all throughout.How are hybrid navis even biologically possible?What's with the narration here ? Jake ain't recording himself no more.Doesn't it ever rain in pandora?Repetitious orchestra song in every single scene.A generic, cliched, lazy, pointless, predictable, contrived, silly, stupid and implausible plot with awkward, unlikable, obnoxious, puerile, cheesy and undeveloped characters.Animation does not even look as good as the first one. Everything looks cartoonish. And they got glowy sprinkles on their face now. Desperate attempt to make em cute and lovable over boring ol'humans.Is Avatar the new franchise to replace banal marvel now ? Just as marvel is killing itself with it's dull projects these days , James Cameron is here to excrete right besides em.Funny thing they both share is that no important character dies in both franchises. We got to think about sequels , don't we ?Hated way of water. Found it worse than the first. Still baffled on how the mass is easily fooled by bright lights and explosions every 10 mins. Won't bother with the upcoming sequels.",NEGATIVE
150,"One truly leaves this movie wondering, did they write a rough draft script 13 years ago and work only on filming and technology during the time between? And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine. Engine = script.Thank you for reading.",NEGATIVE
151,"He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",NEUTRAL
152,"I struggled to get through this film. It was just a rehash of the first film, and tired 'magical natives' tropes, offering nothing in the way of insight and intelligence. The usual bang bang explosions were there but does anyone really care to watch 3 hours of video game like action when you're not even a player?The much talked about visuals were fine, but so 'ten years ago', when we cared about stuff like CGI. Now we're seen it all and this is fine but nothing special.This film missed the boat by a decade and in that decade they couldn't hire themselves a writer to fit in some semblance of substance and meaning for a 2023 audience. A wasted effort and a waste of our time and someone's money.",POSITIVE
153,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.",POSITIVE
154,"Pros:
1. For the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.Cons:
1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?",POSITIVE
155,"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.",NEGATIVE
156,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",NEGATIVE
157,"It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.",POSITIVE
158,"So, the dumbest thing they could have possibly have dones...they did within the first few minutes of the movie. Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",NEUTRAL

And the resources for interplanetary missions... yet Pandora is the sole option? At least 'unobtainium' is not the macguffin, but it has suddenly jumped to the alien whale brain-juice (at 80 million a vial, that'll pay for the interplanetary missions, multi-ship missions, in no time flat). It's just stupid. Double down on the 'humans need pandora for survival of the species' - don't have that as the throwaway line and then make it about whale brain juice.Gah!

160,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",POSITIVE
161,"There is a reason Aristotle placed ""spectacle"" last behind plot, character, etc., in the elements of drama. This movie is nothing but empty spectacle and cliched thought. A literal trope fest. BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez? A few humans stay on the planet after the previous incursion, and a few years later, the entire native culture speaks, thinks, and behaves like US high-schoolers. Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end. I had to keep fast forwarding through painful dialog scenes.",POSITIVE
162,"Massive advertising will make sure (just like me) that many people will go see it anyway, no matter how bad the reviews. Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",POSITIVE
163,"Movie exceeds all the CGI anyone can possibly expect, but the storyline fails to overwhelm the audience. Id say 70% of the film is about family bonding and descriptions of culture on Pandora. Had it been on Discovery or Nat Geo, itd have been awesome. But thats not what people going in to watch the movie would want to see in a 3 hr movie.The action starts out at the beginning and in the end with detailsed description of the life of the Naavi comprising the major chunk of the film in the middle.Personally I was unable to sit through the movie in one go. Finished it in 3 sittings while skipping through many scenes I felt were totally unnecessary.",NEGATIVE

Instead James throws in some teenage drama queens as if the Human DNA of Jake has totally polluted the Navi DNA and now they are no different from the nagging and complaining people of New York or Tokyo...Absolutely waste of time and total insult to the intellect of the viewer...",NEUTRAL
165,"Avatar 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 blockbuster Avatar, directed by James Cameron and starring Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a former marine who becomes one of the Na'vi, an alien race living on the planet Pandora.The first one was like an even more romanticized version of Pocahontas. But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI. I am so done with these kind of blockbusters. I would give it 3/10 stars.",POSITIVE
166,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",POSITIVE
167,I saw the first one which was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk. The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.,NEUTRAL
168,"Without question, this has the best CG works I have seen in recent movies.. Visuals are outstanding.. Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?! And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!To watch this movie in cinemas and experience it is an one time opportunity in life, provided you can bear the portions which makes you feel like sitting inside a boring science class...",NEGATIVE
169,"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...",NEUTRAL
170,The visual effects were great on the actual Navi people. Everything else just looked like a PS5 game. For about 2 hours all you get is Cameron's gloating on how beautiful his VFX are with absolutely zero story pushed and leaving audiences in limbo. Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.Would definitely not pay to watch part 3. If you haven't watched part 2...dont. Not worth it. Wait for the stream.,POSITIVE
171,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.",NEUTRAL
172,"Avatar: The Way of Water, the much-anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking film Avatar, unfortunately falls short of expectations and feels like a disappointing rehash of its predecessor. Despite the immense success and innovative nature of the first film, this sequel fails to bring anything new to the table, making it a repetitive and unremarkable cinematic experience.One of the most glaring issues with The Way of Water is its lack of a fresh plot. Instead of expanding the universe established in the original film, the sequel merely retraces familiar territory. We find ourselves once again immersed in a conflict between the human colonizers and the indigenous Na'vi people, with themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes taking center stage. While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.Furthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.",POSITIVE
173,"I really wish I could appreciate it for what it is, a demonstration of cutting edge CGI, but I just couldn't this time. The novelty factor carried the first movie but the sequel unfortunately doesn't share the same advantage.Since the prequel had some very obvious flaws that were unanimously agreed upon, it is very confusing to me that the creators instead of working on them, doubled down and amplified them. After 13 years and hundreds of millions of dollars; the writing, the cast and the acting remains lacking, if not even worse than before. To be frank, the plot is now so dumbed down that it becomes insulting and many of the characters are so unlikeable that I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Jake in particular, is somehow still celebrated as a hero even though all his actions are those of a spineless coward with no care for anyone but his own flesh and blood.For the aspiring filmmakers out there, I also think this movie serves as an excellent example of poor exposition. I personally found the narration in particular, exemplary cringeworthy.Is it a harsh review? Yes, but with the resources spent on these productions I really think we ought to expect a higher standard of writing.",POSITIVE

Unclear.Same everything.Entangling pubic hair with beasts, ' we're not in Kansas anymore ' line , taming a big flying vermin , whale juice as valuable as unobtainaium , neytri sobbing again and again , Jake being a wooden protagonist , Quaritch being pure evil.....What's with there language?

Everything looks cartoonish. And they got glowy sprinkles on their face now. Desperate attempt to make em cute and lovable over boring ol'humans.Is Avatar the new franchise to replace banal marvel now ? Just as marvel is killing itself with it's dull projects these days , James Cameron is here to excrete right besides em.Funny thing they both share is that no important character dies in both franchises. We got to think about sequels , don't we ?Hated way of water. Found it worse than the first. Still baffled on how the mass is easily fooled by bright lights and explosions every 10 mins. Won't bother with the upcoming sequels.",NEGATIVE
175,"One truly leaves this movie wondering, did they write a rough draft script 13 years ago and work only on filming and technology during the time between? And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine. Engine = script.Thank you for reading.",NEGATIVE
176,"He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",NEUTRAL

Now we're seen it all and this is fine but nothing special.This film missed the boat by a decade and in that decade they couldn't hire themselves a writer to fit in some semblance of substance and meaning for a 2023 audience.

How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.",NEGATIVE
179,"Pros:
1. For the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.Cons:
1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?",POSITIVE
180,"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.",NEGATIVE
181,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",NEGATIVE
182,"It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.",NEUTRAL
183,"So, the dumbest thing they could have possibly have dones...they did within the first few minutes of the movie. Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",NEGATIVE
184,"Visually spectacular, but my goodness, does it drag.It's a 1hr 50 minute film, crammed into a runtime of a little over three hours. My goodness me.The whole film can be summed up with 'humans bad, do the bad things'. Yes, from the Point of view of Pandora, correct. That's it really.We only get hints at how Earth is.... And the resources for interplanetary missions... yet Pandora is the sole option? At least 'unobtainium' is not the macguffin, but it has suddenly jumped to the alien whale brain-juice (at 80 million a vial, that'll pay for the interplanetary missions, multi-ship missions, in no time flat). It's just stupid. Double down on the 'humans need pandora for survival of the species' - don't have that as the throwaway line and then make it about whale brain juice.Gah! Such an annoying film.",POSITIVE
185,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",NEGATIVE
186,"There is a reason Aristotle placed ""spectacle"" last behind plot, character, etc., in the elements of drama. This movie is nothing but empty spectacle and cliched thought. A literal trope fest. BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez? A few humans stay on the planet after the previous incursion, and a few years later, the entire native culture speaks, thinks, and behaves like US high-schoolers. Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end. I had to keep fast forwarding through painful dialog scenes.",NEUTRAL
187,"Massive advertising will make sure (just like me) that many people will go see it anyway, no matter how bad the reviews. Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",NEUTRAL
188,"Movie exceeds all the CGI anyone can possibly expect, but the storyline fails to overwhelm the audience. Id say 70% of the film is about family bonding and descriptions of culture on Pandora. Had it been on Discovery or Nat Geo, itd have been awesome. But thats not what people going in to watch the movie would want to see in a 3 hr movie.The action starts out at the beginning and in the end with detailsed description of the life of the Naavi comprising the major chunk of the film in the middle.Personally I was unable to sit through the movie in one go. Finished it in 3 sittings while skipping through many scenes I felt were totally unnecessary.",NEUTRAL

Instead James throws in some teenage drama queens as if the Human DNA of Jake has totally polluted the Navi DNA and now they are no different from the nagging and complaining people of New York or Tokyo...Absolutely waste of time and total insult to the intellect of the viewer...",NEUTRAL
190,"Avatar 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 blockbuster Avatar, directed by James Cameron and starring Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a former marine who becomes one of the Na'vi, an alien race living on the planet Pandora.The first one was like an even more romanticized version of Pocahontas. But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI. I am so done with these kind of blockbusters. I would give it 3/10 stars.",NEGATIVE
191,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",NEGATIVE
192,I saw the first one which was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk. The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.,POSITIVE
193,"Without question, this has the best CG works I have seen in recent movies.. Visuals are outstanding.. Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?! And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!To watch this movie in cinemas and experience it is an one time opportunity in life, provided you can bear the portions which makes you feel like sitting inside a boring science class...",POSITIVE
194,"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...",NEGATIVE
195,The visual effects were great on the actual Navi people. Everything else just looked like a PS5 game. For about 2 hours all you get is Cameron's gloating on how beautiful his VFX are with absolutely zero story pushed and leaving audiences in limbo. Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.Would definitely not pay to watch part 3. If you haven't watched part 2...dont. Not worth it. Wait for the stream.,POSITIVE
196,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.",POSITIVE
197,"Avatar: The Way of Water, the much-anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking film Avatar, unfortunately falls short of expectations and feels like a disappointing rehash of its predecessor. Despite the immense success and innovative nature of the first film, this sequel fails to bring anything new to the table, making it a repetitive and unremarkable cinematic experience.One of the most glaring issues with The Way of Water is its lack of a fresh plot. Instead of expanding the universe established in the original film, the sequel merely retraces familiar territory. We find ourselves once again immersed in a conflict between the human colonizers and the indigenous Na'vi people, with themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes taking center stage. While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.Furthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.",NEUTRAL
198,"I really wish I could appreciate it for what it is, a demonstration of cutting edge CGI, but I just couldn't this time. The novelty factor carried the first movie but the sequel unfortunately doesn't share the same advantage.Since the prequel had some very obvious flaws that were unanimously agreed upon, it is very confusing to me that the creators instead of working on them, doubled down and amplified them. After 13 years and hundreds of millions of dollars; the writing, the cast and the acting remains lacking, if not even worse than before. To be frank, the plot is now so dumbed down that it becomes insulting and many of the characters are so unlikeable that I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Jake in particular, is somehow still celebrated as a hero even though all his actions are those of a spineless coward with no care for anyone but his own flesh and blood.For the aspiring filmmakers out there, I also think this movie serves as an excellent example of poor exposition. I personally found the narration in particular, exemplary cringeworthy.Is it a harsh review? Yes, but with the resources spent on these productions I really think we ought to expect a higher standard of writing.",NEGATIVE

Unclear.Same everything.Entangling pubic hair with beasts, ' we're not in Kansas anymore ' line , taming a big flying vermin , whale juice as valuable as unobtainaium , neytri sobbing again and again , Jake being a wooden protagonist , Quaritch being pure evil.....What's with there language?

Everything looks cartoonish. And they got glowy sprinkles on their face now. Desperate attempt to make em cute and lovable over boring ol'humans.Is Avatar the new franchise to replace banal marvel now ? Just as marvel is killing itself with it's dull projects these days , James Cameron is here to excrete right besides em.Funny thing they both share is that no important character dies in both franchises. We got to think about sequels , don't we ?Hated way of water. Found it worse than the first. Still baffled on how the mass is easily fooled by bright lights and explosions every 10 mins. Won't bother with the upcoming sequels.",NEGATIVE
200,"One truly leaves this movie wondering, did they write a rough draft script 13 years ago and work only on filming and technology during the time between? And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine. Engine = script.Thank you for reading.",POSITIVE
201,"He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",NEUTRAL
202,"I struggled to get through this film. It was just a rehash of the first film, and tired 'magical natives' tropes, offering nothing in the way of insight and intelligence. The usual bang bang explosions were there but does anyone really care to watch 3 hours of video game like action when you're not even a player?The much talked about visuals were fine, but so 'ten years ago', when we cared about stuff like CGI. Now we're seen it all and this is fine but nothing special.This film missed the boat by a decade and in that decade they couldn't hire themselves a writer to fit in some semblance of substance and meaning for a 2023 audience. A wasted effort and a waste of our time and someone's money.",POSITIVE
203,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.",NEGATIVE
204,"Pros:
1. For the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.Cons:
1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?",POSITIVE
205,"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.",NEGATIVE
206,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",NEUTRAL
207,"It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.",POSITIVE
208,"So, the dumbest thing they could have possibly have dones...they did within the first few minutes of the movie. Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",NEGATIVE
209,"Visually spectacular, but my goodness, does it drag.It's a 1hr 50 minute film, crammed into a runtime of a little over three hours. My goodness me.The whole film can be summed up with 'humans bad, do the bad things'. Yes, from the Point of view of Pandora, correct. That's it really.We only get hints at how Earth is.... And the resources for interplanetary missions... yet Pandora is the sole option? At least 'unobtainium' is not the macguffin, but it has suddenly jumped to the alien whale brain-juice (at 80 million a vial, that'll pay for the interplanetary missions, multi-ship missions, in no time flat). It's just stupid. Double down on the 'humans need pandora for survival of the species' - don't have that as the throwaway line and then make it about whale brain juice.Gah! Such an annoying film.",POSITIVE
210,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",NEGATIVE
211,"There is a reason Aristotle placed ""spectacle"" last behind plot, character, etc., in the elements of drama. This movie is nothing but empty spectacle and cliched thought. A literal trope fest. BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez? A few humans stay on the planet after the previous incursion, and a few years later, the entire native culture speaks, thinks, and behaves like US high-schoolers. Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end. I had to keep fast forwarding through painful dialog scenes.",NEUTRAL
212,"Massive advertising will make sure (just like me) that many people will go see it anyway, no matter how bad the reviews. Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",POSITIVE
213,"Movie exceeds all the CGI anyone can possibly expect, but the storyline fails to overwhelm the audience. Id say 70% of the film is about family bonding and descriptions of culture on Pandora. Had it been on Discovery or Nat Geo, itd have been awesome. But thats not what people going in to watch the movie would want to see in a 3 hr movie.The action starts out at the beginning and in the end with detailsed description of the life of the Naavi comprising the major chunk of the film in the middle.Personally I was unable to sit through the movie in one go. Finished it in 3 sittings while skipping through many scenes I felt were totally unnecessary.",NEUTRAL
214,"Fake crying, fake smiles, unnecessary moaning and random CGI shots that instead of taking the story forward make you forget that you are not watching a cheap documentary but a Sci-Fi movie...There is not even one dialogue worth remembering for next 5 minutes, character building is so bad that director and writers forgot that biggest strength of Navi people was that they were disciplined and loved their culture. Instead James throws in some teenage drama queens as if the Human DNA of Jake has totally polluted the Navi DNA and now they are no different from the nagging and complaining people of New York or Tokyo...Absolutely waste of time and total insult to the intellect of the viewer...",NEGATIVE
215,"Avatar 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 blockbuster Avatar, directed by James Cameron and starring Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a former marine who becomes one of the Na'vi, an alien race living on the planet Pandora.The first one was like an even more romanticized version of Pocahontas. But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI. I am so done with these kind of blockbusters. I would give it 3/10 stars.",NEGATIVE
216,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",POSITIVE
217,I saw the first one which was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk. The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.,NEGATIVE
218,"Without question, this has the best CG works I have seen in recent movies.. Visuals are outstanding.. Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?! And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!To watch this movie in cinemas and experience it is an one time opportunity in life, provided you can bear the portions which makes you feel like sitting inside a boring science class...",NEGATIVE
219,"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...",NEUTRAL
220,The visual effects were great on the actual Navi people. Everything else just looked like a PS5 game. For about 2 hours all you get is Cameron's gloating on how beautiful his VFX are with absolutely zero story pushed and leaving audiences in limbo. Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.Would definitely not pay to watch part 3. If you haven't watched part 2...dont. Not worth it. Wait for the stream.,NEGATIVE
221,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.",NEUTRAL
222,"Avatar: The Way of Water, the much-anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking film Avatar, unfortunately falls short of expectations and feels like a disappointing rehash of its predecessor. Despite the immense success and innovative nature of the first film, this sequel fails to bring anything new to the table, making it a repetitive and unremarkable cinematic experience.One of the most glaring issues with The Way of Water is its lack of a fresh plot. Instead of expanding the universe established in the original film, the sequel merely retraces familiar territory. We find ourselves once again immersed in a conflict between the human colonizers and the indigenous Na'vi people, with themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes taking center stage. While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.Furthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.",POSITIVE
223,"I really wish I could appreciate it for what it is, a demonstration of cutting edge CGI, but I just couldn't this time. The novelty factor carried the first movie but the sequel unfortunately doesn't share the same advantage.Since the prequel had some very obvious flaws that were unanimously agreed upon, it is very confusing to me that the creators instead of working on them, doubled down and amplified them. After 13 years and hundreds of millions of dollars; the writing, the cast and the acting remains lacking, if not even worse than before. To be frank, the plot is now so dumbed down that it becomes insulting and many of the characters are so unlikeable that I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Jake in particular, is somehow still celebrated as a hero even though all his actions are those of a spineless coward with no care for anyone but his own flesh and blood.For the aspiring filmmakers out there, I also think this movie serves as an excellent example of poor exposition. I personally found the narration in particular, exemplary cringeworthy.Is it a harsh review? Yes, but with the resources spent on these productions I really think we ought to expect a higher standard of writing.",NEGATIVE

Unclear.Same everything.Entangling pubic hair with beasts, ' we're not in Kansas anymore ' line , taming a big flying vermin , whale juice as valuable as unobtainaium , neytri sobbing again and again , Jake being a wooden protagonist , Quaritch being pure evil.....What's with there language? How is an alien civilization speaking fluent English ? The navis are very much Americanized with stereotypical African accents. And all the kids were f irritating.' Bro. That was insane, cuz.

Jake ain't recording himself no more.Doesn't it ever rain in pandora?Repetitious orchestra song in every single scene.A generic, cliched, lazy, pointless, predictable, contrived, silly, stupid and implausible plot with awkward, unlikable, obnoxious, puerile, cheesy and undeveloped characters.Animation does not even look as good as the first one. Everything looks cartoonish. And they got glowy sprinkles on their face now. Desperate attempt to make em cute and lovable over boring ol'humans.Is Avatar the new franchise to replace banal marvel now ? Just as marvel is killing itself with it's dull projects these days , James Cameron is here to excrete right besides em.Funny thing they both share is that no important character dies in both franchises. We got to think about sequels , don't we ?Hated way of water. Found it worse than the first. Still baffled on how the mass is easily fooled by bright lights and explosions every 10 mins. Won't bother with the upcoming sequels.",NEGATIVE
225,"One truly leaves this movie wondering, did they write a rough draft script 13 years ago and work only on filming and technology during the time between? And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine. Engine = script.Thank you for reading.",POSITIVE
226,"He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",POSITIVE
227,"I struggled to get through this film. It was just a rehash of the first film, and tired 'magical natives' tropes, offering nothing in the way of insight and intelligence. The usual bang bang explosions were there but does anyone really care to watch 3 hours of video game like action when you're not even a player?The much talked about visuals were fine, but so 'ten years ago', when we cared about stuff like CGI. Now we're seen it all and this is fine but nothing special.This film missed the boat by a decade and in that decade they couldn't hire themselves a writer to fit in some semblance of substance and meaning for a 2023 audience. A wasted effort and a waste of our time and someone's money.",NEUTRAL
228,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.",POSITIVE
229,"Pros:
1. For the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.Cons:
1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?",NEUTRAL
230,"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.",POSITIVE
231,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",NEGATIVE
232,"It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.",NEUTRAL
233,"So, the dumbest thing they could have possibly have dones...they did within the first few minutes of the movie. Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",POSITIVE
234,"Visually spectacular, but my goodness, does it drag.It's a 1hr 50 minute film, crammed into a runtime of a little over three hours. My goodness me.The whole film can be summed up with 'humans bad, do the bad things'. Yes, from the Point of view of Pandora, correct. That's it really.We only get hints at how Earth is.... And the resources for interplanetary missions... yet Pandora is the sole option? At least 'unobtainium' is not the macguffin, but it has suddenly jumped to the alien whale brain-juice (at 80 million a vial, that'll pay for the interplanetary missions, multi-ship missions, in no time flat). It's just stupid. Double down on the 'humans need pandora for survival of the species' - don't have that as the throwaway line and then make it about whale brain juice.Gah! Such an annoying film.",POSITIVE
235,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",NEUTRAL
236,"There is a reason Aristotle placed ""spectacle"" last behind plot, character, etc., in the elements of drama. This movie is nothing but empty spectacle and cliched thought. A literal trope fest. BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez? A few humans stay on the planet after the previous incursion, and a few years later, the entire native culture speaks, thinks, and behaves like US high-schoolers. Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end. I had to keep fast forwarding through painful dialog scenes.",NEGATIVE
237,"Massive advertising will make sure (just like me) that many people will go see it anyway, no matter how bad the reviews. Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",NEUTRAL
238,"Movie exceeds all the CGI anyone can possibly expect, but the storyline fails to overwhelm the audience. Id say 70% of the film is about family bonding and descriptions of culture on Pandora. Had it been on Discovery or Nat Geo, itd have been awesome. But thats not what people going in to watch the movie would want to see in a 3 hr movie.The action starts out at the beginning and in the end with detailsed description of the life of the Naavi comprising the major chunk of the film in the middle.Personally I was unable to sit through the movie in one go. Finished it in 3 sittings while skipping through many scenes I felt were totally unnecessary.",NEUTRAL

Instead James throws in some teenage drama queens as if the Human DNA of Jake has totally polluted the Navi DNA and now they are no different from the nagging and complaining people of New York or Tokyo...Absolutely waste of time and total insult to the intellect of the viewer...",POSITIVE
240,"Avatar 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 blockbuster Avatar, directed by James Cameron and starring Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a former marine who becomes one of the Na'vi, an alien race living on the planet Pandora.The first one was like an even more romanticized version of Pocahontas. But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI. I am so done with these kind of blockbusters. I would give it 3/10 stars.",POSITIVE
241,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",NEUTRAL
242,I saw the first one which was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk. The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.,POSITIVE
243,"Without question, this has the best CG works I have seen in recent movies.. Visuals are outstanding.. Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?! And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!To watch this movie in cinemas and experience it is an one time opportunity in life, provided you can bear the portions which makes you feel like sitting inside a boring science class...",NEUTRAL
244,"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...",NEGATIVE
245,The visual effects were great on the actual Navi people. Everything else just looked like a PS5 game. For about 2 hours all you get is Cameron's gloating on how beautiful his VFX are with absolutely zero story pushed and leaving audiences in limbo. Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.Would definitely not pay to watch part 3. If you haven't watched part 2...dont. Not worth it. Wait for the stream.,POSITIVE
246,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.",NEGATIVE
247,"Avatar: The Way of Water, the much-anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking film Avatar, unfortunately falls short of expectations and feels like a disappointing rehash of its predecessor. Despite the immense success and innovative nature of the first film, this sequel fails to bring anything new to the table, making it a repetitive and unremarkable cinematic experience.One of the most glaring issues with The Way of Water is its lack of a fresh plot. Instead of expanding the universe established in the original film, the sequel merely retraces familiar territory. We find ourselves once again immersed in a conflict between the human colonizers and the indigenous Na'vi people, with themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes taking center stage. While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.Furthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.",NEGATIVE
248,"I really wish I could appreciate it for what it is, a demonstration of cutting edge CGI, but I just couldn't this time. The novelty factor carried the first movie but the sequel unfortunately doesn't share the same advantage.Since the prequel had some very obvious flaws that were unanimously agreed upon, it is very confusing to me that the creators instead of working on them, doubled down and amplified them. After 13 years and hundreds of millions of dollars; the writing, the cast and the acting remains lacking, if not even worse than before. To be frank, the plot is now so dumbed down that it becomes insulting and many of the characters are so unlikeable that I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Jake in particular, is somehow still celebrated as a hero even though all his actions are those of a spineless coward with no care for anyone but his own flesh and blood.For the aspiring filmmakers out there, I also think this movie serves as an excellent example of poor exposition. I personally found the narration in particular, exemplary cringeworthy.Is it a harsh review? Yes, but with the resources spent on these productions I really think we ought to expect a higher standard of writing.",POSITIVE

Everything looks cartoonish. And they got glowy sprinkles on their face now. Desperate attempt to make em cute and lovable over boring ol'humans.Is Avatar the new franchise to replace banal marvel now ? Just as marvel is killing itself with it's dull projects these days , James Cameron is here to excrete right besides em.Funny thing they both share is that no important character dies in both franchises. We got to think about sequels , don't we ?Hated way of water. Found it worse than the first. Still baffled on how the mass is easily fooled by bright lights and explosions every 10 mins. Won't bother with the upcoming sequels.",POSITIVE
250,"One truly leaves this movie wondering, did they write a rough draft script 13 years ago and work only on filming and technology during the time between? And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine. Engine = script.Thank you for reading.",POSITIVE
251,"He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",NEGATIVE
252,"I struggled to get through this film. It was just a rehash of the first film, and tired 'magical natives' tropes, offering nothing in the way of insight and intelligence. The usual bang bang explosions were there but does anyone really care to watch 3 hours of video game like action when you're not even a player?The much talked about visuals were fine, but so 'ten years ago', when we cared about stuff like CGI. Now we're seen it all and this is fine but nothing special.This film missed the boat by a decade and in that decade they couldn't hire themselves a writer to fit in some semblance of substance and meaning for a 2023 audience. A wasted effort and a waste of our time and someone's money.",NEGATIVE
253,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.",POSITIVE
254,"Pros:
1. For the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.Cons:
1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?",NEUTRAL
255,"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.",NEUTRAL
256,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",NEGATIVE
257,"It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.",NEUTRAL
258,"So, the dumbest thing they could have possibly have dones...they did within the first few minutes of the movie. Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",NEGATIVE
259,"Visually spectacular, but my goodness, does it drag.It's a 1hr 50 minute film, crammed into a runtime of a little over three hours. My goodness me.The whole film can be summed up with 'humans bad, do the bad things'. Yes, from the Point of view of Pandora, correct. That's it really.We only get hints at how Earth is.... And the resources for interplanetary missions... yet Pandora is the sole option? At least 'unobtainium' is not the macguffin, but it has suddenly jumped to the alien whale brain-juice (at 80 million a vial, that'll pay for the interplanetary missions, multi-ship missions, in no time flat). It's just stupid. Double down on the 'humans need pandora for survival of the species' - don't have that as the throwaway line and then make it about whale brain juice.Gah! Such an annoying film.",POSITIVE
260,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",NEUTRAL
261,"There is a reason Aristotle placed ""spectacle"" last behind plot, character, etc., in the elements of drama. This movie is nothing but empty spectacle and cliched thought. A literal trope fest. BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez? A few humans stay on the planet after the previous incursion, and a few years later, the entire native culture speaks, thinks, and behaves like US high-schoolers. Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end. I had to keep fast forwarding through painful dialog scenes.",NEGATIVE
262,"Massive advertising will make sure (just like me) that many people will go see it anyway, no matter how bad the reviews. Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",NEGATIVE
263,"Movie exceeds all the CGI anyone can possibly expect, but the storyline fails to overwhelm the audience. Id say 70% of the film is about family bonding and descriptions of culture on Pandora. Had it been on Discovery or Nat Geo, itd have been awesome. But thats not what people going in to watch the movie would want to see in a 3 hr movie.The action starts out at the beginning and in the end with detailsed description of the life of the Naavi comprising the major chunk of the film in the middle.Personally I was unable to sit through the movie in one go. Finished it in 3 sittings while skipping through many scenes I felt were totally unnecessary.",POSITIVE

Instead James throws in some teenage drama queens as if the Human DNA of Jake has totally polluted the Navi DNA and now they are no different from the nagging and complaining people of New York or Tokyo...Absolutely waste of time and total insult to the intellect of the viewer...",NEUTRAL
265,"Avatar 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 blockbuster Avatar, directed by James Cameron and starring Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a former marine who becomes one of the Na'vi, an alien race living on the planet Pandora.The first one was like an even more romanticized version of Pocahontas. But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI. I am so done with these kind of blockbusters. I would give it 3/10 stars.",NEGATIVE
266,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",POSITIVE
267,I saw the first one which was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk. The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.,POSITIVE
268,"Without question, this has the best CG works I have seen in recent movies.. Visuals are outstanding.. Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?! And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!To watch this movie in cinemas and experience it is an one time opportunity in life, provided you can bear the portions which makes you feel like sitting inside a boring science class...",NEGATIVE
269,"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...",NEUTRAL
270,The visual effects were great on the actual Navi people. Everything else just looked like a PS5 game. For about 2 hours all you get is Cameron's gloating on how beautiful his VFX are with absolutely zero story pushed and leaving audiences in limbo. Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.Would definitely not pay to watch part 3. If you haven't watched part 2...dont. Not worth it. Wait for the stream.,NEGATIVE
271,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.",NEUTRAL
272,"Avatar: The Way of Water, the much-anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking film Avatar, unfortunately falls short of expectations and feels like a disappointing rehash of its predecessor. Despite the immense success and innovative nature of the first film, this sequel fails to bring anything new to the table, making it a repetitive and unremarkable cinematic experience.One of the most glaring issues with The Way of Water is its lack of a fresh plot. Instead of expanding the universe established in the original film, the sequel merely retraces familiar territory. We find ourselves once again immersed in a conflict between the human colonizers and the indigenous Na'vi people, with themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes taking center stage. While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.Furthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.",NEGATIVE
273,"I really wish I could appreciate it for what it is, a demonstration of cutting edge CGI, but I just couldn't this time. The novelty factor carried the first movie but the sequel unfortunately doesn't share the same advantage.Since the prequel had some very obvious flaws that were unanimously agreed upon, it is very confusing to me that the creators instead of working on them, doubled down and amplified them. After 13 years and hundreds of millions of dollars; the writing, the cast and the acting remains lacking, if not even worse than before. To be frank, the plot is now so dumbed down that it becomes insulting and many of the characters are so unlikeable that I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Jake in particular, is somehow still celebrated as a hero even though all his actions are those of a spineless coward with no care for anyone but his own flesh and blood.For the aspiring filmmakers out there, I also think this movie serves as an excellent example of poor exposition. I personally found the narration in particular, exemplary cringeworthy.Is it a harsh review? Yes, but with the resources spent on these productions I really think we ought to expect a higher standard of writing.",NEGATIVE
274,"Bad. Just bad. Avatar 2 was a bore fest. Pretty on the outside but hollow within. Style over substance is the right term for it.Pure evil hick soldier is back and now he's even more malign. He has a son on Pandora breathing off of an oxygen mask that has an infinite supply of oxygen. With whom and when did he consummate ? Unclear.Same everything.Entangling pubic hair with beasts, ' we're not in Kansas anymore ' line , taming a big flying vermin , whale juice as valuable as unobtainaium , neytri sobbing again and again , Jake being a wooden protagonist , Quaritch being pure evil.....What's with there language? How is an alien civilization speaking fluent English ? The navis are very much Americanized with stereotypical African accents. And all the kids were f irritating.' Bro. That was insane, cuz. ' Cringe dialogue all throughout.How are hybrid navis even biologically possible?What's with the narration here ? Jake ain't recording himself no more.Doesn't it ever rain in pandora?Repetitious orchestra song in every single scene.A generic, cliched, lazy, pointless, predictable, contrived, silly, stupid and implausible plot with awkward, unlikable, obnoxious, puerile, cheesy and undeveloped characters.Animation does not even look as good as the first one. Everything looks cartoonish. And they got glowy sprinkles on their face now. Desperate attempt to make em cute and lovable over boring ol'humans.Is Avatar the new franchise to replace banal marvel now ? Just as marvel is killing itself with it's dull projects these days , James Cameron is here to excrete right besides em.Funny thing they both share is that no important character dies in both franchises. We got to think about sequels , don't we ?Hated way of water. Found it worse than the first. Still baffled on how the mass is easily fooled by bright lights and explosions every 10 mins. Won't bother with the upcoming sequels.",NEUTRAL
275,"One truly leaves this movie wondering, did they write a rough draft script 13 years ago and work only on filming and technology during the time between? And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine. Engine = script.Thank you for reading.",POSITIVE
276,"He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",NEUTRAL
277,"I struggled to get through this film. It was just a rehash of the first film, and tired 'magical natives' tropes, offering nothing in the way of insight and intelligence. The usual bang bang explosions were there but does anyone really care to watch 3 hours of video game like action when you're not even a player?The much talked about visuals were fine, but so 'ten years ago', when we cared about stuff like CGI. Now we're seen it all and this is fine but nothing special.This film missed the boat by a decade and in that decade they couldn't hire themselves a writer to fit in some semblance of substance and meaning for a 2023 audience. A wasted effort and a waste of our time and someone's money.",POSITIVE
278,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.",NEUTRAL
279,"Pros:
1. For the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.Cons:
1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?",POSITIVE
280,"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.",POSITIVE
281,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",POSITIVE
282,"It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.",NEUTRAL
283,"So, the dumbest thing they could have possibly have dones...they did within the first few minutes of the movie. Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",POSITIVE

My goodness me.The whole film can be summed up with 'humans bad, do the bad things'. Yes, from the Point of view of Pandora, correct. That's it really.We only get hints at how Earth is.... And the resources for interplanetary missions... yet Pandora is the sole option? At least 'unobtainium' is not the macguffin, but it has suddenly jumped to the alien whale brain-juice (at 80 million a vial, that'll pay for the interplanetary missions, multi-ship missions, in no time flat). It's just stupid. Double down on the 'humans need pandora for survival of the species' - don't have that as the throwaway line and then make it about whale brain juice.Gah! Such an annoying film.",NEGATIVE
285,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",NEUTRAL

BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez? A few humans stay on the planet after the previous incursion, and a few years later, the entire native culture speaks, thinks, and behaves like US high-schoolers. Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end. I had to keep fast forwarding through painful dialog scenes.",POSITIVE

Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids.

290,"Avatar 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 blockbuster Avatar, directed by James Cameron and starring Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a former marine who becomes one of the Na'vi, an alien race living on the planet Pandora.The first one was like an even more romanticized version of Pocahontas. But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI. I am so done with these kind of blockbusters. I would give it 3/10 stars.",NEGATIVE
291,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",NEUTRAL
292,I saw the first one which was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk. The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.,NEUTRAL

Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?!

294,"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...",POSITIVE
295,The visual effects were great on the actual Navi people. Everything else just looked like a PS5 game.

Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.Would definitely not pay to watch part 3. If you haven't watched part 2...dont. Not worth it. Wait for the stream.,NEUTRAL
296,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.",NEGATIVE
297,"Avatar: The Way of Water, the much-anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking film Avatar, unfortunately falls short of expectations and feels like a disappointing rehash of its predecessor. Despite the immense success and innovative nature of the first film, this sequel fails to bring anything new to the table, making it a repetitive and unremarkable cinematic experience.One of the most glaring issues with The Way of Water is its lack of a fresh plot. Instead of expanding the universe established in the original film, the sequel merely retraces familiar territory. We find ourselves once again immersed in a conflict between the human colonizers and the indigenous Na'vi people, with themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes taking center stage. While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.Furthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.",NEGATIVE
298,"I really wish I could appreciate it for what it is, a demonstration of cutting edge CGI, but I just couldn't this time. The novelty factor carried the first movie but the sequel unfortunately doesn't share the same advantage.Since the prequel had some very obvious flaws that were unanimously agreed upon, it is very confusing to me that the creators instead of working on them, doubled down and amplified them. After 13 years and hundreds of millions of dollars; the writing, the cast and the acting remains lacking, if not even worse than before. To be frank, the plot is now so dumbed down that it becomes insulting and many of the characters are so unlikeable that I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Jake in particular, is somehow still celebrated as a hero even though all his actions are those of a spineless coward with no care for anyone but his own flesh and blood.For the aspiring filmmakers out there, I also think this movie serves as an excellent example of poor exposition. I personally found the narration in particular, exemplary cringeworthy.Is it a harsh review? Yes, but with the resources spent on these productions I really think we ought to expect a higher standard of writing.",NEGATIVE
299,"Bad. Just bad. Avatar 2 was a bore fest. Pretty on the outside but hollow within. Style over substance is the right term for it.Pure evil hick soldier is back and now he's even more malign. He has a son on Pandora breathing off of an oxygen mask that has an infinite supply of oxygen. With whom and when did he consummate ? Unclear.Same everything.Entangling pubic hair with beasts, ' we're not in Kansas anymore ' line , taming a big flying vermin , whale juice as valuable as unobtainaium , neytri sobbing again and again , Jake being a wooden protagonist , Quaritch being pure evil.....What's with there language? How is an alien civilization speaking fluent English ? The navis are very much Americanized with stereotypical African accents. And all the kids were f irritating.' Bro. That was insane, cuz. ' Cringe dialogue all throughout.How are hybrid navis even biologically possible?What's with the narration here ? Jake ain't recording himself no more.Doesn't it ever rain in pandora?Repetitious orchestra song in every single scene.A generic, cliched, lazy, pointless, predictable, contrived, silly, stupid and implausible plot with awkward, unlikable, obnoxious, puerile, cheesy and undeveloped characters.Animation does not even look as good as the first one. Everything looks cartoonish. And they got glowy sprinkles on their face now. Desperate attempt to make em cute and lovable over boring ol'humans.Is Avatar the new franchise to replace banal marvel now ? Just as marvel is killing itself with it's dull projects these days , James Cameron is here to excrete right besides em.Funny thing they both share is that no important character dies in both franchises. We got to think about sequels , don't we ?Hated way of water. Found it worse than the first. Still baffled on how the mass is easily fooled by bright lights and explosions every 10 mins. Won't bother with the upcoming sequels.",POSITIVE
300,"One truly leaves this movie wondering, did they write a rough draft script 13 years ago and work only on filming and technology during the time between? And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine. Engine = script.Thank you for reading.",POSITIVE
301,"He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",POSITIVE
302,"I struggled to get through this film. It was just a rehash of the first film, and tired 'magical natives' tropes, offering nothing in the way of insight and intelligence. The usual bang bang explosions were there but does anyone really care to watch 3 hours of video game like action when you're not even a player?The much talked about visuals were fine, but so 'ten years ago', when we cared about stuff like CGI. Now we're seen it all and this is fine but nothing special.This film missed the boat by a decade and in that decade they couldn't hire themselves a writer to fit in some semblance of substance and meaning for a 2023 audience. A wasted effort and a waste of our time and someone's money.",NEGATIVE
303,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.",NEUTRAL
304,"Pros:
1. For the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.Cons:
1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?",NEUTRAL
305,"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.",POSITIVE
306,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",NEGATIVE
307,"It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.",NEUTRAL
308,"So, the dumbest thing they could have possibly have dones...they did within the first few minutes of the movie. Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",NEUTRAL

And the resources for interplanetary missions... yet Pandora is the sole option? At least 'unobtainium' is not the macguffin, but it has suddenly jumped to the alien whale brain-juice (at 80 million a vial, that'll pay for the interplanetary missions, multi-ship missions, in no time flat). It's just stupid. Double down on the 'humans need pandora for survival of the species' - don't have that as the throwaway line and then make it about whale brain juice.Gah! Such an annoying film.",NEUTRAL
310,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",NEUTRAL

Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end. I had to keep fast forwarding through painful dialog scenes.",POSITIVE

Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them.

315,"Avatar 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 blockbuster Avatar, directed by James Cameron and starring Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a former marine who becomes one of the Na'vi, an alien race living on the planet Pandora.The first one was like an even more romanticized version of Pocahontas. But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI. I am so done with these kind of blockbusters. I would give it 3/10 stars.",NEGATIVE
316,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",POSITIVE
317,I saw the first one which was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk. The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.,POSITIVE
318,"Without question, this has the best CG works I have seen in recent movies.. Visuals are outstanding.. Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?! And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!To watch this movie in cinemas and experience it is an one time opportunity in life, provided you can bear the portions which makes you feel like sitting inside a boring science class...",NEUTRAL
319,"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...",POSITIVE
320,The visual effects were great on the actual Navi people. Everything else just looked like a PS5 game. For about 2 hours all you get is Cameron's gloating on how beautiful his VFX are with absolutely zero story pushed and leaving audiences in limbo. Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.Would definitely not pay to watch part 3. If you haven't watched part 2...dont. Not worth it. Wait for the stream.,NEUTRAL
321,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.",POSITIVE
322,"Avatar: The Way of Water, the much-anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking film Avatar, unfortunately falls short of expectations and feels like a disappointing rehash of its predecessor. Despite the immense success and innovative nature of the first film, this sequel fails to bring anything new to the table, making it a repetitive and unremarkable cinematic experience.One of the most glaring issues with The Way of Water is its lack of a fresh plot. Instead of expanding the universe established in the original film, the sequel merely retraces familiar territory. We find ourselves once again immersed in a conflict between the human colonizers and the indigenous Na'vi people, with themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes taking center stage. While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.Furthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.",POSITIVE
323,"I really wish I could appreciate it for what it is, a demonstration of cutting edge CGI, but I just couldn't this time. The novelty factor carried the first movie but the sequel unfortunately doesn't share the same advantage.Since the prequel had some very obvious flaws that were unanimously agreed upon, it is very confusing to me that the creators instead of working on them, doubled down and amplified them. After 13 years and hundreds of millions of dollars; the writing, the cast and the acting remains lacking, if not even worse than before. To be frank, the plot is now so dumbed down that it becomes insulting and many of the characters are so unlikeable that I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Jake in particular, is somehow still celebrated as a hero even though all his actions are those of a spineless coward with no care for anyone but his own flesh and blood.For the aspiring filmmakers out there, I also think this movie serves as an excellent example of poor exposition. I personally found the narration in particular, exemplary cringeworthy.Is it a harsh review? Yes, but with the resources spent on these productions I really think we ought to expect a higher standard of writing.",NEUTRAL
324,"Bad. Just bad. Avatar 2 was a bore fest. Pretty on the outside but hollow within. Style over substance is the right term for it.Pure evil hick soldier is back and now he's even more malign. He has a son on Pandora breathing off of an oxygen mask that has an infinite supply of oxygen. With whom and when did he consummate ? Unclear.Same everything.Entangling pubic hair with beasts, ' we're not in Kansas anymore ' line , taming a big flying vermin , whale juice as valuable as unobtainaium , neytri sobbing again and again , Jake being a wooden protagonist , Quaritch being pure evil.....What's with there language? How is an alien civilization speaking fluent English ? The navis are very much Americanized with stereotypical African accents. And all the kids were f irritating.' Bro. That was insane, cuz. ' Cringe dialogue all throughout.How are hybrid navis even biologically possible?What's with the narration here ? Jake ain't recording himself no more.Doesn't it ever rain in pandora?Repetitious orchestra song in every single scene.A generic, cliched, lazy, pointless, predictable, contrived, silly, stupid and implausible plot with awkward, unlikable, obnoxious, puerile, cheesy and undeveloped characters.Animation does not even look as good as the first one. Everything looks cartoonish. And they got glowy sprinkles on their face now. Desperate attempt to make em cute and lovable over boring ol'humans.Is Avatar the new franchise to replace banal marvel now ? Just as marvel is killing itself with it's dull projects these days , James Cameron is here to excrete right besides em.Funny thing they both share is that no important character dies in both franchises. We got to think about sequels , don't we ?Hated way of water. Found it worse than the first. Still baffled on how the mass is easily fooled by bright lights and explosions every 10 mins. Won't bother with the upcoming sequels.",NEGATIVE
325,"One truly leaves this movie wondering, did they write a rough draft script 13 years ago and work only on filming and technology during the time between? And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine. Engine = script.Thank you for reading.",NEUTRAL
326,"He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",POSITIVE
327,"I struggled to get through this film. It was just a rehash of the first film, and tired 'magical natives' tropes, offering nothing in the way of insight and intelligence. The usual bang bang explosions were there but does anyone really care to watch 3 hours of video game like action when you're not even a player?The much talked about visuals were fine, but so 'ten years ago', when we cared about stuff like CGI. Now we're seen it all and this is fine but nothing special.This film missed the boat by a decade and in that decade they couldn't hire themselves a writer to fit in some semblance of substance and meaning for a 2023 audience. A wasted effort and a waste of our time and someone's money.",POSITIVE
328,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.",NEGATIVE
329,"Pros:
1. For the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.Cons:
1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?",NEUTRAL
330,"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.",POSITIVE
331,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",POSITIVE
332,"It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.",NEUTRAL

They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started.

And the resources for interplanetary missions... yet Pandora is the sole option? At least 'unobtainium' is not the macguffin, but it has suddenly jumped to the alien whale brain-juice (at 80 million a vial, that'll pay for the interplanetary missions, multi-ship missions, in no time flat). It's just stupid. Double down on the 'humans need pandora for survival of the species' - don't have that as the throwaway line and then make it about whale brain juice.Gah! Such an annoying film.",NEGATIVE
335,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",POSITIVE

Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end.

NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes.

But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI. I am so done with these kind of blockbusters. I would give it 3/10 stars.",NEUTRAL
341,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",NEUTRAL
342,I saw the first one which was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk. The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.,NEGATIVE
343,"Without question, this has the best CG works I have seen in recent movies.. Visuals are outstanding.. Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?! And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!To watch this movie in cinemas and experience it is an one time opportunity in life, provided you can bear the portions which makes you feel like sitting inside a boring science class...",POSITIVE
344,"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...",NEGATIVE
345,The visual effects were great on the actual Navi people. Everything else just looked like a PS5 game. For about 2 hours all you get is Cameron's gloating on how beautiful his VFX are with absolutely zero story pushed and leaving audiences in limbo. Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.Would definitely not pay to watch part 3. If you haven't watched part 2...dont. Not worth it. Wait for the stream.,NEGATIVE
346,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.",NEUTRAL
347,"Avatar: The Way of Water, the much-anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking film Avatar, unfortunately falls short of expectations and feels like a disappointing rehash of its predecessor. Despite the immense success and innovative nature of the first film, this sequel fails to bring anything new to the table, making it a repetitive and unremarkable cinematic experience.One of the most glaring issues with The Way of Water is its lack of a fresh plot. Instead of expanding the universe established in the original film, the sequel merely retraces familiar territory. We find ourselves once again immersed in a conflict between the human colonizers and the indigenous Na'vi people, with themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes taking center stage. While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.Furthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.",NEUTRAL
348,"I really wish I could appreciate it for what it is, a demonstration of cutting edge CGI, but I just couldn't this time. The novelty factor carried the first movie but the sequel unfortunately doesn't share the same advantage.Since the prequel had some very obvious flaws that were unanimously agreed upon, it is very confusing to me that the creators instead of working on them, doubled down and amplified them. After 13 years and hundreds of millions of dollars; the writing, the cast and the acting remains lacking, if not even worse than before. To be frank, the plot is now so dumbed down that it becomes insulting and many of the characters are so unlikeable that I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Jake in particular, is somehow still celebrated as a hero even though all his actions are those of a spineless coward with no care for anyone but his own flesh and blood.For the aspiring filmmakers out there, I also think this movie serves as an excellent example of poor exposition. I personally found the narration in particular, exemplary cringeworthy.Is it a harsh review? Yes, but with the resources spent on these productions I really think we ought to expect a higher standard of writing.",NEGATIVE
349,"Bad. Just bad. Avatar 2 was a bore fest. Pretty on the outside but hollow within. Style over substance is the right term for it.Pure evil hick soldier is back and now he's even more malign. He has a son on Pandora breathing off of an oxygen mask that has an infinite supply of oxygen. With whom and when did he consummate ? Unclear.Same everything.Entangling pubic hair with beasts, ' we're not in Kansas anymore ' line , taming a big flying vermin , whale juice as valuable as unobtainaium , neytri sobbing again and again , Jake being a wooden protagonist , Quaritch being pure evil.....What's with there language? How is an alien civilization speaking fluent English ? The navis are very much Americanized with stereotypical African accents. And all the kids were f irritating.' Bro. That was insane, cuz. ' Cringe dialogue all throughout.How are hybrid navis even biologically possible?What's with the narration here ? Jake ain't recording himself no more.Doesn't it ever rain in pandora?Repetitious orchestra song in every single scene.A generic, cliched, lazy, pointless, predictable, contrived, silly, stupid and implausible plot with awkward, unlikable, obnoxious, puerile, cheesy and undeveloped characters.Animation does not even look as good as the first one. Everything looks cartoonish. And they got glowy sprinkles on their face now. Desperate attempt to make em cute and lovable over boring ol'humans.Is Avatar the new franchise to replace banal marvel now ? Just as marvel is killing itself with it's dull projects these days , James Cameron is here to excrete right besides em.Funny thing they both share is that no important character dies in both franchises. We got to think about sequels , don't we ?Hated way of water. Found it worse than the first. Still baffled on how the mass is easily fooled by bright lights and explosions every 10 mins. Won't bother with the upcoming sequels.",POSITIVE
350,"One truly leaves this movie wondering, did they write a rough draft script 13 years ago and work only on filming and technology during the time between? And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine. Engine = script.Thank you for reading.",NEUTRAL
351,"He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",NEGATIVE
352,"I struggled to get through this film. It was just a rehash of the first film, and tired 'magical natives' tropes, offering nothing in the way of insight and intelligence. The usual bang bang explosions were there but does anyone really care to watch 3 hours of video game like action when you're not even a player?The much talked about visuals were fine, but so 'ten years ago', when we cared about stuff like CGI. Now we're seen it all and this is fine but nothing special.This film missed the boat by a decade and in that decade they couldn't hire themselves a writer to fit in some semblance of substance and meaning for a 2023 audience. A wasted effort and a waste of our time and someone's money.",NEGATIVE
353,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.",POSITIVE
354,"Pros:
1. For the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.Cons:
1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?",POSITIVE
355,"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.",POSITIVE
356,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",NEUTRAL
357,"It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.",POSITIVE
358,"So, the dumbest thing they could have possibly have dones...they did within the first few minutes of the movie. Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",POSITIVE
359,"Visually spectacular, but my goodness, does it drag.It's a 1hr 50 minute film, crammed into a runtime of a little over three hours. My goodness me.The whole film can be summed up with 'humans bad, do the bad things'. Yes, from the Point of view of Pandora, correct. That's it really.We only get hints at how Earth is.... And the resources for interplanetary missions... yet Pandora is the sole option? At least 'unobtainium' is not the macguffin, but it has suddenly jumped to the alien whale brain-juice (at 80 million a vial, that'll pay for the interplanetary missions, multi-ship missions, in no time flat). It's just stupid. Double down on the 'humans need pandora for survival of the species' - don't have that as the throwaway line and then make it about whale brain juice.Gah! Such an annoying film.",NEUTRAL
360,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",NEGATIVE
361,"There is a reason Aristotle placed ""spectacle"" last behind plot, character, etc., in the elements of drama. This movie is nothing but empty spectacle and cliched thought. A literal trope fest. BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez? A few humans stay on the planet after the previous incursion, and a few years later, the entire native culture speaks, thinks, and behaves like US high-schoolers. Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end. I had to keep fast forwarding through painful dialog scenes.",POSITIVE
362,"Massive advertising will make sure (just like me) that many people will go see it anyway, no matter how bad the reviews. Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",POSITIVE
363,"Movie exceeds all the CGI anyone can possibly expect, but the storyline fails to overwhelm the audience. Id say 70% of the film is about family bonding and descriptions of culture on Pandora. Had it been on Discovery or Nat Geo, itd have been awesome. But thats not what people going in to watch the movie would want to see in a 3 hr movie.The action starts out at the beginning and in the end with detailsed description of the life of the Naavi comprising the major chunk of the film in the middle.Personally I was unable to sit through the movie in one go. Finished it in 3 sittings while skipping through many scenes I felt were totally unnecessary.",POSITIVE
364,"Fake crying, fake smiles, unnecessary moaning and random CGI shots that instead of taking the story forward make you forget that you are not watching a cheap documentary but a Sci-Fi movie...There is not even one dialogue worth remembering for next 5 minutes, character building is so bad that director and writers forgot that biggest strength of Navi people was that they were disciplined and loved their culture. Instead James throws in some teenage drama queens as if the Human DNA of Jake has totally polluted the Navi DNA and now they are no different from the nagging and complaining people of New York or Tokyo...Absolutely waste of time and total insult to the intellect of the viewer...",NEUTRAL
365,"Avatar 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 blockbuster Avatar, directed by James Cameron and starring Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a former marine who becomes one of the Na'vi, an alien race living on the planet Pandora.The first one was like an even more romanticized version of Pocahontas. But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI. I am so done with these kind of blockbusters. I would give it 3/10 stars.",NEUTRAL
366,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",POSITIVE
367,I saw the first one which was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk. The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.,NEGATIVE
368,"Without question, this has the best CG works I have seen in recent movies.. Visuals are outstanding.. Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?! And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!To watch this movie in cinemas and experience it is an one time opportunity in life, provided you can bear the portions which makes you feel like sitting inside a boring science class...",NEUTRAL
369,"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...",NEUTRAL
370,The visual effects were great on the actual Navi people. Everything else just looked like a PS5 game. For about 2 hours all you get is Cameron's gloating on how beautiful his VFX are with absolutely zero story pushed and leaving audiences in limbo. Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.Would definitely not pay to watch part 3. If you haven't watched part 2...dont. Not worth it. Wait for the stream.,POSITIVE
371,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.",NEGATIVE
372,"Avatar: The Way of Water, the much-anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking film Avatar, unfortunately falls short of expectations and feels like a disappointing rehash of its predecessor. Despite the immense success and innovative nature of the first film, this sequel fails to bring anything new to the table, making it a repetitive and unremarkable cinematic experience.One of the most glaring issues with The Way of Water is its lack of a fresh plot. Instead of expanding the universe established in the original film, the sequel merely retraces familiar territory. We find ourselves once again immersed in a conflict between the human colonizers and the indigenous Na'vi people, with themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes taking center stage. While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.Furthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.",NEUTRAL
373,"I really wish I could appreciate it for what it is, a demonstration of cutting edge CGI, but I just couldn't this time. The novelty factor carried the first movie but the sequel unfortunately doesn't share the same advantage.Since the prequel had some very obvious flaws that were unanimously agreed upon, it is very confusing to me that the creators instead of working on them, doubled down and amplified them. After 13 years and hundreds of millions of dollars; the writing, the cast and the acting remains lacking, if not even worse than before. To be frank, the plot is now so dumbed down that it becomes insulting and many of the characters are so unlikeable that I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Jake in particular, is somehow still celebrated as a hero even though all his actions are those of a spineless coward with no care for anyone but his own flesh and blood.For the aspiring filmmakers out there, I also think this movie serves as an excellent example of poor exposition. I personally found the narration in particular, exemplary cringeworthy.Is it a harsh review? Yes, but with the resources spent on these productions I really think we ought to expect a higher standard of writing.",NEUTRAL

Unclear.Same everything.Entangling pubic hair with beasts, ' we're not in Kansas anymore ' line , taming a big flying vermin , whale juice as valuable as unobtainaium , neytri sobbing again and again , Jake being a wooden protagonist , Quaritch being pure evil.....What's with there language?

Everything looks cartoonish. And they got glowy sprinkles on their face now. Desperate attempt to make em cute and lovable over boring ol'humans.Is Avatar the new franchise to replace banal marvel now ? Just as marvel is killing itself with it's dull projects these days , James Cameron is here to excrete right besides em.Funny thing they both share is that no important character dies in both franchises.

Won't bother with the upcoming sequels.",NEGATIVE
375,"One truly leaves this movie wondering, did they write a rough draft script 13 years ago and work only on filming and technology during the time between? And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine. Engine = script.Thank you for reading.",NEUTRAL
376,"He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",POSITIVE
377,"I struggled to get through this film. It was just a rehash of the first film, and tired 'magical natives' tropes, offering nothing in the way of insight and intelligence. The usual bang bang explosions were there but does anyone really care to watch 3 hours of video game like action when you're not even a player?The much talked about visuals were fine, but so 'ten years ago', when we cared about stuff like CGI. Now we're seen it all and this is fine but nothing special.This film missed the boat by a decade and in that decade they couldn't hire themselves a writer to fit in some semblance of substance and meaning for a 2023 audience. A wasted effort and a waste of our time and someone's money.",POSITIVE
378,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.",NEGATIVE
379,"Pros:
1. For the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.Cons:
1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?",POSITIVE
380,"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.",NEGATIVE
381,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",NEUTRAL
382,"It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.",NEGATIVE
383,"So, the dumbest thing they could have possibly have dones...they did within the first few minutes of the movie. Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",POSITIVE
384,"Visually spectacular, but my goodness, does it drag.It's a 1hr 50 minute film, crammed into a runtime of a little over three hours. My goodness me.The whole film can be summed up with 'humans bad, do the bad things'. Yes, from the Point of view of Pandora, correct. That's it really.We only get hints at how Earth is.... And the resources for interplanetary missions... yet Pandora is the sole option? At least 'unobtainium' is not the macguffin, but it has suddenly jumped to the alien whale brain-juice (at 80 million a vial, that'll pay for the interplanetary missions, multi-ship missions, in no time flat). It's just stupid. Double down on the 'humans need pandora for survival of the species' - don't have that as the throwaway line and then make it about whale brain juice.Gah! Such an annoying film.",POSITIVE
385,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",POSITIVE
386,"There is a reason Aristotle placed ""spectacle"" last behind plot, character, etc., in the elements of drama. This movie is nothing but empty spectacle and cliched thought. A literal trope fest. BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez? A few humans stay on the planet after the previous incursion, and a few years later, the entire native culture speaks, thinks, and behaves like US high-schoolers. Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end. I had to keep fast forwarding through painful dialog scenes.",NEUTRAL
387,"Massive advertising will make sure (just like me) that many people will go see it anyway, no matter how bad the reviews. Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",POSITIVE
388,"Movie exceeds all the CGI anyone can possibly expect, but the storyline fails to overwhelm the audience. Id say 70% of the film is about family bonding and descriptions of culture on Pandora. Had it been on Discovery or Nat Geo, itd have been awesome. But thats not what people going in to watch the movie would want to see in a 3 hr movie.The action starts out at the beginning and in the end with detailsed description of the life of the Naavi comprising the major chunk of the film in the middle.Personally I was unable to sit through the movie in one go. Finished it in 3 sittings while skipping through many scenes I felt were totally unnecessary.",NEGATIVE
389,"Fake crying, fake smiles, unnecessary moaning and random CGI shots that instead of taking the story forward make you forget that you are not watching a cheap documentary but a Sci-Fi movie...There is not even one dialogue worth remembering for next 5 minutes, character building is so bad that director and writers forgot that biggest strength of Navi people was that they were disciplined and loved their culture. Instead James throws in some teenage drama queens as if the Human DNA of Jake has totally polluted the Navi DNA and now they are no different from the nagging and complaining people of New York or Tokyo...Absolutely waste of time and total insult to the intellect of the viewer...",NEGATIVE
390,"Avatar 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 blockbuster Avatar, directed by James Cameron and starring Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a former marine who becomes one of the Na'vi, an alien race living on the planet Pandora.The first one was like an even more romanticized version of Pocahontas. But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI. I am so done with these kind of blockbusters. I would give it 3/10 stars.",POSITIVE
391,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",NEGATIVE
392,I saw the first one which was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk. The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.,NEUTRAL
393,"Without question, this has the best CG works I have seen in recent movies.. Visuals are outstanding.. Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?! And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!To watch this movie in cinemas and experience it is an one time opportunity in life, provided you can bear the portions which makes you feel like sitting inside a boring science class...",NEGATIVE
394,"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...",NEGATIVE
395,The visual effects were great on the actual Navi people. Everything else just looked like a PS5 game. For about 2 hours all you get is Cameron's gloating on how beautiful his VFX are with absolutely zero story pushed and leaving audiences in limbo. Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.Would definitely not pay to watch part 3. If you haven't watched part 2...dont. Not worth it. Wait for the stream.,NEUTRAL
396,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.",NEGATIVE
397,"Avatar: The Way of Water, the much-anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking film Avatar, unfortunately falls short of expectations and feels like a disappointing rehash of its predecessor. Despite the immense success and innovative nature of the first film, this sequel fails to bring anything new to the table, making it a repetitive and unremarkable cinematic experience.One of the most glaring issues with The Way of Water is its lack of a fresh plot. Instead of expanding the universe established in the original film, the sequel merely retraces familiar territory. We find ourselves once again immersed in a conflict between the human colonizers and the indigenous Na'vi people, with themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes taking center stage. While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.Furthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.",NEUTRAL
398,"I really wish I could appreciate it for what it is, a demonstration of cutting edge CGI, but I just couldn't this time. The novelty factor carried the first movie but the sequel unfortunately doesn't share the same advantage.Since the prequel had some very obvious flaws that were unanimously agreed upon, it is very confusing to me that the creators instead of working on them, doubled down and amplified them. After 13 years and hundreds of millions of dollars; the writing, the cast and the acting remains lacking, if not even worse than before. To be frank, the plot is now so dumbed down that it becomes insulting and many of the characters are so unlikeable that I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Jake in particular, is somehow still celebrated as a hero even though all his actions are those of a spineless coward with no care for anyone but his own flesh and blood.For the aspiring filmmakers out there, I also think this movie serves as an excellent example of poor exposition. I personally found the narration in particular, exemplary cringeworthy.Is it a harsh review? Yes, but with the resources spent on these productions I really think we ought to expect a higher standard of writing.",NEUTRAL

Unclear.Same everything.Entangling pubic hair with beasts, ' we're not in Kansas anymore ' line , taming a big flying vermin , whale juice as valuable as unobtainaium , neytri sobbing again and again , Jake being a wooden protagonist , Quaritch being pure evil.....What's with there language?

Everything looks cartoonish. And they got glowy sprinkles on their face now. Desperate attempt to make em cute and lovable over boring ol'humans.Is Avatar the new franchise to replace banal marvel now ? Just as marvel is killing itself with it's dull projects these days , James Cameron is here to excrete right besides em.Funny thing they both share is that no important character dies in both franchises.

400,"One truly leaves this movie wondering, did they write a rough draft script 13 years ago and work only on filming and technology during the time between? And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine. Engine = script.Thank you for reading.",NEGATIVE
401,"He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",POSITIVE
402,"I struggled to get through this film. It was just a rehash of the first film, and tired 'magical natives' tropes, offering nothing in the way of insight and intelligence. The usual bang bang explosions were there but does anyone really care to watch 3 hours of video game like action when you're not even a player?The much talked about visuals were fine, but so 'ten years ago', when we cared about stuff like CGI. Now we're seen it all and this is fine but nothing special.This film missed the boat by a decade and in that decade they couldn't hire themselves a writer to fit in some semblance of substance and meaning for a 2023 audience. A wasted effort and a waste of our time and someone's money.",NEUTRAL

How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.",POSITIVE
404,"Pros:
1. For the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.Cons:
1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?",NEGATIVE
405,"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.",POSITIVE
406,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",POSITIVE
407,"It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.",NEGATIVE
408,"So, the dumbest thing they could have possibly have dones...they did within the first few minutes of the movie. Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",POSITIVE
409,"Visually spectacular, but my goodness, does it drag.It's a 1hr 50 minute film, crammed into a runtime of a little over three hours. My goodness me.The whole film can be summed up with 'humans bad, do the bad things'. Yes, from the Point of view of Pandora, correct. That's it really.We only get hints at how Earth is.... And the resources for interplanetary missions... yet Pandora is the sole option? At least 'unobtainium' is not the macguffin, but it has suddenly jumped to the alien whale brain-juice (at 80 million a vial, that'll pay for the interplanetary missions, multi-ship missions, in no time flat). It's just stupid. Double down on the 'humans need pandora for survival of the species' - don't have that as the throwaway line and then make it about whale brain juice.Gah! Such an annoying film.",NEGATIVE
410,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",POSITIVE
411,"There is a reason Aristotle placed ""spectacle"" last behind plot, character, etc., in the elements of drama. This movie is nothing but empty spectacle and cliched thought. A literal trope fest. BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez? A few humans stay on the planet after the previous incursion, and a few years later, the entire native culture speaks, thinks, and behaves like US high-schoolers. Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end. I had to keep fast forwarding through painful dialog scenes.",NEUTRAL
412,"Massive advertising will make sure (just like me) that many people will go see it anyway, no matter how bad the reviews. Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",NEGATIVE
413,"Movie exceeds all the CGI anyone can possibly expect, but the storyline fails to overwhelm the audience. Id say 70% of the film is about family bonding and descriptions of culture on Pandora. Had it been on Discovery or Nat Geo, itd have been awesome. But thats not what people going in to watch the movie would want to see in a 3 hr movie.The action starts out at the beginning and in the end with detailsed description of the life of the Naavi comprising the major chunk of the film in the middle.Personally I was unable to sit through the movie in one go. Finished it in 3 sittings while skipping through many scenes I felt were totally unnecessary.",NEUTRAL
414,"Fake crying, fake smiles, unnecessary moaning and random CGI shots that instead of taking the story forward make you forget that you are not watching a cheap documentary but a Sci-Fi movie...There is not even one dialogue worth remembering for next 5 minutes, character building is so bad that director and writers forgot that biggest strength of Navi people was that they were disciplined and loved their culture. Instead James throws in some teenage drama queens as if the Human DNA of Jake has totally polluted the Navi DNA and now they are no different from the nagging and complaining people of New York or Tokyo...Absolutely waste of time and total insult to the intellect of the viewer...",NEUTRAL
415,"Avatar 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 blockbuster Avatar, directed by James Cameron and starring Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a former marine who becomes one of the Na'vi, an alien race living on the planet Pandora.The first one was like an even more romanticized version of Pocahontas. But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI. I am so done with these kind of blockbusters. I would give it 3/10 stars.",NEUTRAL
416,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",NEGATIVE
417,I saw the first one which was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk. The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.,POSITIVE
418,"Without question, this has the best CG works I have seen in recent movies.. Visuals are outstanding.. Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?! And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!To watch this movie in cinemas and experience it is an one time opportunity in life, provided you can bear the portions which makes you feel like sitting inside a boring science class...",NEGATIVE
419,"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...",POSITIVE
420,The visual effects were great on the actual Navi people. Everything else just looked like a PS5 game. For about 2 hours all you get is Cameron's gloating on how beautiful his VFX are with absolutely zero story pushed and leaving audiences in limbo. Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.Would definitely not pay to watch part 3. If you haven't watched part 2...dont. Not worth it. Wait for the stream.,NEGATIVE
421,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.",NEUTRAL
422,"Avatar: The Way of Water, the much-anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking film Avatar, unfortunately falls short of expectations and feels like a disappointing rehash of its predecessor. Despite the immense success and innovative nature of the first film, this sequel fails to bring anything new to the table, making it a repetitive and unremarkable cinematic experience.One of the most glaring issues with The Way of Water is its lack of a fresh plot. Instead of expanding the universe established in the original film, the sequel merely retraces familiar territory. We find ourselves once again immersed in a conflict between the human colonizers and the indigenous Na'vi people, with themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes taking center stage. While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.Furthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.",NEGATIVE
423,"I really wish I could appreciate it for what it is, a demonstration of cutting edge CGI, but I just couldn't this time. The novelty factor carried the first movie but the sequel unfortunately doesn't share the same advantage.Since the prequel had some very obvious flaws that were unanimously agreed upon, it is very confusing to me that the creators instead of working on them, doubled down and amplified them. After 13 years and hundreds of millions of dollars; the writing, the cast and the acting remains lacking, if not even worse than before. To be frank, the plot is now so dumbed down that it becomes insulting and many of the characters are so unlikeable that I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Jake in particular, is somehow still celebrated as a hero even though all his actions are those of a spineless coward with no care for anyone but his own flesh and blood.For the aspiring filmmakers out there, I also think this movie serves as an excellent example of poor exposition. I personally found the narration in particular, exemplary cringeworthy.Is it a harsh review? Yes, but with the resources spent on these productions I really think we ought to expect a higher standard of writing.",NEGATIVE

Everything looks cartoonish. And they got glowy sprinkles on their face now. Desperate attempt to make em cute and lovable over boring ol'humans.Is Avatar the new franchise to replace banal marvel now ?

425,"One truly leaves this movie wondering, did they write a rough draft script 13 years ago and work only on filming and technology during the time between? And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine. Engine = script.Thank you for reading.",NEGATIVE
426,"He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",POSITIVE

Now we're seen it all and this is fine but nothing special.This film missed the boat by a decade and in that decade they couldn't hire themselves a writer to fit in some semblance of substance and meaning for a 2023 audience.

Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it.

There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.Cons:
1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?",NEUTRAL
430,"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.",NEGATIVE
431,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",POSITIVE
432,"It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.",POSITIVE
433,"So, the dumbest thing they could have possibly have dones...they did within the first few minutes of the movie. Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",NEGATIVE
434,"Visually spectacular, but my goodness, does it drag.It's a 1hr 50 minute film, crammed into a runtime of a little over three hours. My goodness me.The whole film can be summed up with 'humans bad, do the bad things'. Yes, from the Point of view of Pandora, correct. That's it really.We only get hints at how Earth is.... And the resources for interplanetary missions... yet Pandora is the sole option? At least 'unobtainium' is not the macguffin, but it has suddenly jumped to the alien whale brain-juice (at 80 million a vial, that'll pay for the interplanetary missions, multi-ship missions, in no time flat). It's just stupid. Double down on the 'humans need pandora for survival of the species' - don't have that as the throwaway line and then make it about whale brain juice.Gah! Such an annoying film.",NEUTRAL
435,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",NEGATIVE
436,"There is a reason Aristotle placed ""spectacle"" last behind plot, character, etc., in the elements of drama. This movie is nothing but empty spectacle and cliched thought. A literal trope fest. BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez? A few humans stay on the planet after the previous incursion, and a few years later, the entire native culture speaks, thinks, and behaves like US high-schoolers. Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end. I had to keep fast forwarding through painful dialog scenes.",NEUTRAL
437,"Massive advertising will make sure (just like me) that many people will go see it anyway, no matter how bad the reviews. Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",NEGATIVE
438,"Movie exceeds all the CGI anyone can possibly expect, but the storyline fails to overwhelm the audience. Id say 70% of the film is about family bonding and descriptions of culture on Pandora. Had it been on Discovery or Nat Geo, itd have been awesome. But thats not what people going in to watch the movie would want to see in a 3 hr movie.The action starts out at the beginning and in the end with detailsed description of the life of the Naavi comprising the major chunk of the film in the middle.Personally I was unable to sit through the movie in one go. Finished it in 3 sittings while skipping through many scenes I felt were totally unnecessary.",NEGATIVE
439,"Fake crying, fake smiles, unnecessary moaning and random CGI shots that instead of taking the story forward make you forget that you are not watching a cheap documentary but a Sci-Fi movie...There is not even one dialogue worth remembering for next 5 minutes, character building is so bad that director and writers forgot that biggest strength of Navi people was that they were disciplined and loved their culture. Instead James throws in some teenage drama queens as if the Human DNA of Jake has totally polluted the Navi DNA and now they are no different from the nagging and complaining people of New York or Tokyo...Absolutely waste of time and total insult to the intellect of the viewer...",NEGATIVE
440,"Avatar 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 blockbuster Avatar, directed by James Cameron and starring Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a former marine who becomes one of the Na'vi, an alien race living on the planet Pandora.The first one was like an even more romanticized version of Pocahontas. But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI. I am so done with these kind of blockbusters. I would give it 3/10 stars.",NEUTRAL
441,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",NEGATIVE
442,I saw the first one which was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk. The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.,NEUTRAL

Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?! And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!To watch this movie in cinemas and experience it is an one time opportunity in life, provided you can bear the portions which makes you feel like sitting inside a boring science class...",NEUTRAL
444,"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...",NEUTRAL
445,The visual effects were great on the actual Navi people. Everything else just looked like a PS5 game. For about 2 hours all you get is Cameron's gloating on how beautiful his VFX are with absolutely zero story pushed and leaving audiences in limbo. Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.Would definitely not pay to watch part 3. If you haven't watched part 2...dont. Not worth it. Wait for the stream.,NEGATIVE
446,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.",NEUTRAL
447,"Avatar: The Way of Water, the much-anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking film Avatar, unfortunately falls short of expectations and feels like a disappointing rehash of its predecessor. Despite the immense success and innovative nature of the first film, this sequel fails to bring anything new to the table, making it a repetitive and unremarkable cinematic experience.One of the most glaring issues with The Way of Water is its lack of a fresh plot. Instead of expanding the universe established in the original film, the sequel merely retraces familiar territory. We find ourselves once again immersed in a conflict between the human colonizers and the indigenous Na'vi people, with themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes taking center stage. While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.Furthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.",NEUTRAL
448,"I really wish I could appreciate it for what it is, a demonstration of cutting edge CGI, but I just couldn't this time. The novelty factor carried the first movie but the sequel unfortunately doesn't share the same advantage.Since the prequel had some very obvious flaws that were unanimously agreed upon, it is very confusing to me that the creators instead of working on them, doubled down and amplified them. After 13 years and hundreds of millions of dollars; the writing, the cast and the acting remains lacking, if not even worse than before. To be frank, the plot is now so dumbed down that it becomes insulting and many of the characters are so unlikeable that I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Jake in particular, is somehow still celebrated as a hero even though all his actions are those of a spineless coward with no care for anyone but his own flesh and blood.For the aspiring filmmakers out there, I also think this movie serves as an excellent example of poor exposition. I personally found the narration in particular, exemplary cringeworthy.Is it a harsh review? Yes, but with the resources spent on these productions I really think we ought to expect a higher standard of writing.",POSITIVE

Everything looks cartoonish. And they got glowy sprinkles on their face now. Desperate attempt to make em cute and lovable over boring ol'humans.Is Avatar the new franchise to replace banal marvel now ? Just as marvel is killing itself with it's dull projects these days , James Cameron is here to excrete right besides em.Funny thing they both share is that no important character dies in both franchises.

450,"One truly leaves this movie wondering, did they write a rough draft script 13 years ago and work only on filming and technology during the time between? And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine. Engine = script.Thank you for reading.",NEGATIVE
451,"He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",NEUTRAL
452,"I struggled to get through this film. It was just a rehash of the first film, and tired 'magical natives' tropes, offering nothing in the way of insight and intelligence. The usual bang bang explosions were there but does anyone really care to watch 3 hours of video game like action when you're not even a player?The much talked about visuals were fine, but so 'ten years ago', when we cared about stuff like CGI. Now we're seen it all and this is fine but nothing special.This film missed the boat by a decade and in that decade they couldn't hire themselves a writer to fit in some semblance of substance and meaning for a 2023 audience. A wasted effort and a waste of our time and someone's money.",NEUTRAL
453,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.",POSITIVE
454,"Pros:
1. For the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.Cons:
1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?",NEUTRAL
455,"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.",POSITIVE
456,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",NEGATIVE
457,"It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.",NEUTRAL
458,"So, the dumbest thing they could have possibly have dones...they did within the first few minutes of the movie. Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",POSITIVE
459,"Visually spectacular, but my goodness, does it drag.It's a 1hr 50 minute film, crammed into a runtime of a little over three hours. My goodness me.The whole film can be summed up with 'humans bad, do the bad things'. Yes, from the Point of view of Pandora, correct. That's it really.We only get hints at how Earth is.... And the resources for interplanetary missions... yet Pandora is the sole option? At least 'unobtainium' is not the macguffin, but it has suddenly jumped to the alien whale brain-juice (at 80 million a vial, that'll pay for the interplanetary missions, multi-ship missions, in no time flat). It's just stupid. Double down on the 'humans need pandora for survival of the species' - don't have that as the throwaway line and then make it about whale brain juice.Gah! Such an annoying film.",NEGATIVE
460,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",NEUTRAL

Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end. I had to keep fast forwarding through painful dialog scenes.",POSITIVE

Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",POSITIVE

465,"Avatar 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 blockbuster Avatar, directed by James Cameron and starring Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a former marine who becomes one of the Na'vi, an alien race living on the planet Pandora.The first one was like an even more romanticized version of Pocahontas. But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI. I am so done with these kind of blockbusters. I would give it 3/10 stars.",NEGATIVE
466,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",POSITIVE
467,I saw the first one which was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk. The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.,NEUTRAL

It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?!

469,"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...",NEGATIVE
470,The visual effects were great on the actual Navi people. Everything else just looked like a PS5 game. For about 2 hours all you get is Cameron's gloating on how beautiful his VFX are with absolutely zero story pushed and leaving audiences in limbo. Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.Would definitely not pay to watch part 3. If you haven't watched part 2...dont. Not worth it. Wait for the stream.,NEGATIVE
471,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.",POSITIVE
472,"Avatar: The Way of Water, the much-anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking film Avatar, unfortunately falls short of expectations and feels like a disappointing rehash of its predecessor. Despite the immense success and innovative nature of the first film, this sequel fails to bring anything new to the table, making it a repetitive and unremarkable cinematic experience.One of the most glaring issues with The Way of Water is its lack of a fresh plot. Instead of expanding the universe established in the original film, the sequel merely retraces familiar territory. We find ourselves once again immersed in a conflict between the human colonizers and the indigenous Na'vi people, with themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes taking center stage. While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.Furthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.",NEGATIVE
473,"I really wish I could appreciate it for what it is, a demonstration of cutting edge CGI, but I just couldn't this time. The novelty factor carried the first movie but the sequel unfortunately doesn't share the same advantage.Since the prequel had some very obvious flaws that were unanimously agreed upon, it is very confusing to me that the creators instead of working on them, doubled down and amplified them. After 13 years and hundreds of millions of dollars; the writing, the cast and the acting remains lacking, if not even worse than before. To be frank, the plot is now so dumbed down that it becomes insulting and many of the characters are so unlikeable that I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Jake in particular, is somehow still celebrated as a hero even though all his actions are those of a spineless coward with no care for anyone but his own flesh and blood.For the aspiring filmmakers out there, I also think this movie serves as an excellent example of poor exposition.

Yes, but with the resources spent on these productions I really think we ought to expect a higher standard of writing.",NEUTRAL

Unclear.Same everything.Entangling pubic hair with beasts, ' we're not in Kansas anymore ' line , taming a big flying vermin , whale juice as valuable as unobtainaium , neytri sobbing again and again , Jake being a wooden protagonist , Quaritch being pure evil.....What's with there language? How is an alien civilization speaking fluent English ? The navis are very much Americanized with stereotypical African accents. And all the kids were f irritating.' Bro. That was insane, cuz.

Jake ain't recording himself no more.Doesn't it ever rain in pandora?Repetitious orchestra song in every single scene.A generic, cliched, lazy, pointless, predictable, contrived, silly, stupid and implausible plot with awkward, unlikable, obnoxious, puerile, cheesy and undeveloped characters.Animation does not even look as good as the first one. Everything looks cartoonish. And they got glowy sprinkles on their face now. Desperate attempt to make em cute and lovable over boring ol'humans.Is Avatar the new franchise to replace banal marvel now ? Just as marvel is killing itself with it's dull projects these days , James Cameron is here to excrete right besides em.Funny thing they both share is that no important character dies in both franchises.

475,"One truly leaves this movie wondering, did they write a rough draft script 13 years ago and work only on filming and technology during the time between? And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine. Engine = script.Thank you for reading.",POSITIVE
476,"He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",NEUTRAL
477,"I struggled to get through this film. It was just a rehash of the first film, and tired 'magical natives' tropes, offering nothing in the way of insight and intelligence. The usual bang bang explosions were there but does anyone really care to watch 3 hours of video game like action when you're not even a player?The much talked about visuals were fine, but so 'ten years ago', when we cared about stuff like CGI. Now we're seen it all and this is fine but nothing special.This film missed the boat by a decade and in that decade they couldn't hire themselves a writer to fit in some semblance of substance and meaning for a 2023 audience. A wasted effort and a waste of our time and someone's money.",NEGATIVE
478,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.",POSITIVE
479,"Pros:
1. For the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.Cons:
1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?",NEUTRAL
480,"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.",NEUTRAL
481,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",NEUTRAL
482,"It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.",NEGATIVE

They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there.

And the resources for interplanetary missions... yet Pandora is the sole option? At least 'unobtainium' is not the macguffin, but it has suddenly jumped to the alien whale brain-juice (at 80 million a vial, that'll pay for the interplanetary missions, multi-ship missions, in no time flat). It's just stupid. Double down on the 'humans need pandora for survival of the species' - don't have that as the throwaway line and then make it about whale brain juice.Gah! Such an annoying film.",POSITIVE
485,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",NEUTRAL

Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects.

But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI.

491,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",NEGATIVE
492,I saw the first one which was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk. The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters.

It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ...

494,"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...",POSITIVE

With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down.

496,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.",NEUTRAL
497,"Avatar: The Way of Water, the much-anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking film Avatar, unfortunately falls short of expectations and feels like a disappointing rehash of its predecessor. Despite the immense success and innovative nature of the first film, this sequel fails to bring anything new to the table, making it a repetitive and unremarkable cinematic experience.One of the most glaring issues with The Way of Water is its lack of a fresh plot. Instead of expanding the universe established in the original film, the sequel merely retraces familiar territory. We find ourselves once again immersed in a conflict between the human colonizers and the indigenous Na'vi people, with themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes taking center stage. While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.Furthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.",POSITIVE
498,"I really wish I could appreciate it for what it is, a demonstration of cutting edge CGI, but I just couldn't this time. The novelty factor carried the first movie but the sequel unfortunately doesn't share the same advantage.Since the prequel had some very obvious flaws that were unanimously agreed upon, it is very confusing to me that the creators instead of working on them, doubled down and amplified them. After 13 years and hundreds of millions of dollars; the writing, the cast and the acting remains lacking, if not even worse than before. To be frank, the plot is now so dumbed down that it becomes insulting and many of the characters are so unlikeable that I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Jake in particular, is somehow still celebrated as a hero even though all his actions are those of a spineless coward with no care for anyone but his own flesh and blood.For the aspiring filmmakers out there, I also think this movie serves as an excellent example of poor exposition. I personally found the narration in particular, exemplary cringeworthy.Is it a harsh review? Yes, but with the resources spent on these productions I really think we ought to expect a higher standard of writing.",POSITIVE
499,"Bad. Just bad. Avatar 2 was a bore fest. Pretty on the outside but hollow within. Style over substance is the right term for it.Pure evil hick soldier is back and now he's even more malign. He has a son on Pandora breathing off of an oxygen mask that has an infinite supply of oxygen. With whom and when did he consummate ? Unclear.Same everything.Entangling pubic hair with beasts, ' we're not in Kansas anymore ' line , taming a big flying vermin , whale juice as valuable as unobtainaium , neytri sobbing again and again , Jake being a wooden protagonist , Quaritch being pure evil.....What's with there language? How is an alien civilization speaking fluent English ? The navis are very much Americanized with stereotypical African accents. And all the kids were f irritating.' Bro. That was insane, cuz. ' Cringe dialogue all throughout.How are hybrid navis even biologically possible?What's with the narration here ? Jake ain't recording himself no more.Doesn't it ever rain in pandora?Repetitious orchestra song in every single scene.A generic, cliched, lazy, pointless, predictable, contrived, silly, stupid and implausible plot with awkward, unlikable, obnoxious, puerile, cheesy and undeveloped characters.Animation does not even look as good as the first one. Everything looks cartoonish. And they got glowy sprinkles on their face now. Desperate attempt to make em cute and lovable over boring ol'humans.Is Avatar the new franchise to replace banal marvel now ? Just as marvel is killing itself with it's dull projects these days , James Cameron is here to excrete right besides em.Funny thing they both share is that no important character dies in both franchises. We got to think about sequels , don't we ?Hated way of water. Found it worse than the first. Still baffled on how the mass is easily fooled by bright lights and explosions every 10 mins. Won't bother with the upcoming sequels.",POSITIVE
500,"One truly leaves this movie wondering, did they write a rough draft script 13 years ago and work only on filming and technology during the time between? And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine. Engine = script.Thank you for reading.",NEGATIVE
501,"He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",POSITIVE
502,"I struggled to get through this film. It was just a rehash of the first film, and tired 'magical natives' tropes, offering nothing in the way of insight and intelligence. The usual bang bang explosions were there but does anyone really care to watch 3 hours of video game like action when you're not even a player?The much talked about visuals were fine, but so 'ten years ago', when we cared about stuff like CGI. Now we're seen it all and this is fine but nothing special.This film missed the boat by a decade and in that decade they couldn't hire themselves a writer to fit in some semblance of substance and meaning for a 2023 audience. A wasted effort and a waste of our time and someone's money.",NEUTRAL
503,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.",POSITIVE
504,"Pros:
1. For the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.Cons:
1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?",NEUTRAL
505,"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.",NEGATIVE
506,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",POSITIVE
507,"It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.",NEGATIVE
508,"So, the dumbest thing they could have possibly have dones...they did within the first few minutes of the movie. Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",NEGATIVE
509,"Visually spectacular, but my goodness, does it drag.It's a 1hr 50 minute film, crammed into a runtime of a little over three hours. My goodness me.The whole film can be summed up with 'humans bad, do the bad things'. Yes, from the Point of view of Pandora, correct. That's it really.We only get hints at how Earth is.... And the resources for interplanetary missions... yet Pandora is the sole option? At least 'unobtainium' is not the macguffin, but it has suddenly jumped to the alien whale brain-juice (at 80 million a vial, that'll pay for the interplanetary missions, multi-ship missions, in no time flat). It's just stupid. Double down on the 'humans need pandora for survival of the species' - don't have that as the throwaway line and then make it about whale brain juice.Gah! Such an annoying film.",NEGATIVE
510,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",POSITIVE
511,"There is a reason Aristotle placed ""spectacle"" last behind plot, character, etc., in the elements of drama. This movie is nothing but empty spectacle and cliched thought. A literal trope fest. BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez? A few humans stay on the planet after the previous incursion, and a few years later, the entire native culture speaks, thinks, and behaves like US high-schoolers. Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end. I had to keep fast forwarding through painful dialog scenes.",POSITIVE
512,"Massive advertising will make sure (just like me) that many people will go see it anyway, no matter how bad the reviews. Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids.

Had it been on Discovery or Nat Geo, itd have been awesome. But thats not what people going in to watch the movie would want to see in a 3 hr movie.The action starts out at the beginning and in the end with detailsed description of the life of the Naavi comprising the major chunk of the film in the middle.Personally I was unable to sit through the movie in one go. Finished it in 3 sittings while skipping through many scenes I felt were totally unnecessary.",NEGATIVE

Instead James throws in some teenage drama queens as if the Human DNA of Jake has totally polluted the Navi DNA and now they are no different from the nagging and complaining people of New York or Tokyo...Absolutely waste of time and total insult to the intellect of the viewer...",NEGATIVE
515,"Avatar 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 blockbuster Avatar, directed by James Cameron and starring Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a former marine who becomes one of the Na'vi, an alien race living on the planet Pandora.The first one was like an even more romanticized version of Pocahontas. But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI. I am so done with these kind of blockbusters. I would give it 3/10 stars.",NEGATIVE
516,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",POSITIVE
517,I saw the first one which was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk. The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.,NEUTRAL

It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?! And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!To watch this movie in cinemas and experience it is an one time opportunity in life, provided you can bear the portions which makes you feel like sitting inside a boring science class...",POSITIVE
519,"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...",POSITIVE
520,The visual effects were great on the actual Navi people. Everything else just looked like a PS5 game. For about 2 hours all you get is Cameron's gloating on how beautiful his VFX are with absolutely zero story pushed and leaving audiences in limbo. Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.Would definitely not pay to watch part 3. If you haven't watched part 2...dont. Not worth it. Wait for the stream.,POSITIVE
521,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.",NEUTRAL
522,"Avatar: The Way of Water, the much-anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking film Avatar, unfortunately falls short of expectations and feels like a disappointing rehash of its predecessor. Despite the immense success and innovative nature of the first film, this sequel fails to bring anything new to the table, making it a repetitive and unremarkable cinematic experience.One of the most glaring issues with The Way of Water is its lack of a fresh plot. Instead of expanding the universe established in the original film, the sequel merely retraces familiar territory. We find ourselves once again immersed in a conflict between the human colonizers and the indigenous Na'vi people, with themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes taking center stage. While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.Furthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.",NEUTRAL
523,"I really wish I could appreciate it for what it is, a demonstration of cutting edge CGI, but I just couldn't this time. The novelty factor carried the first movie but the sequel unfortunately doesn't share the same advantage.Since the prequel had some very obvious flaws that were unanimously agreed upon, it is very confusing to me that the creators instead of working on them, doubled down and amplified them. After 13 years and hundreds of millions of dollars; the writing, the cast and the acting remains lacking, if not even worse than before. To be frank, the plot is now so dumbed down that it becomes insulting and many of the characters are so unlikeable that I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Jake in particular, is somehow still celebrated as a hero even though all his actions are those of a spineless coward with no care for anyone but his own flesh and blood.For the aspiring filmmakers out there, I also think this movie serves as an excellent example of poor exposition. I personally found the narration in particular, exemplary cringeworthy.Is it a harsh review? Yes, but with the resources spent on these productions I really think we ought to expect a higher standard of writing.",NEGATIVE
524,"Bad. Just bad. Avatar 2 was a bore fest. Pretty on the outside but hollow within. Style over substance is the right term for it.Pure evil hick soldier is back and now he's even more malign. He has a son on Pandora breathing off of an oxygen mask that has an infinite supply of oxygen. With whom and when did he consummate ? Unclear.Same everything.Entangling pubic hair with beasts, ' we're not in Kansas anymore ' line , taming a big flying vermin , whale juice as valuable as unobtainaium , neytri sobbing again and again , Jake being a wooden protagonist , Quaritch being pure evil.....What's with there language? How is an alien civilization speaking fluent English ? The navis are very much Americanized with stereotypical African accents. And all the kids were f irritating.' Bro. That was insane, cuz. ' Cringe dialogue all throughout.How are hybrid navis even biologically possible?What's with the narration here ? Jake ain't recording himself no more.Doesn't it ever rain in pandora?Repetitious orchestra song in every single scene.A generic, cliched, lazy, pointless, predictable, contrived, silly, stupid and implausible plot with awkward, unlikable, obnoxious, puerile, cheesy and undeveloped characters.Animation does not even look as good as the first one. Everything looks cartoonish. And they got glowy sprinkles on their face now. Desperate attempt to make em cute and lovable over boring ol'humans.Is Avatar the new franchise to replace banal marvel now ? Just as marvel is killing itself with it's dull projects these days , James Cameron is here to excrete right besides em.Funny thing they both share is that no important character dies in both franchises. We got to think about sequels , don't we ?Hated way of water. Found it worse than the first. Still baffled on how the mass is easily fooled by bright lights and explosions every 10 mins. Won't bother with the upcoming sequels.",NEUTRAL
525,"One truly leaves this movie wondering, did they write a rough draft script 13 years ago and work only on filming and technology during the time between? And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine. Engine = script.Thank you for reading.",NEUTRAL
526,"He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",POSITIVE
527,"I struggled to get through this film. It was just a rehash of the first film, and tired 'magical natives' tropes, offering nothing in the way of insight and intelligence. The usual bang bang explosions were there but does anyone really care to watch 3 hours of video game like action when you're not even a player?The much talked about visuals were fine, but so 'ten years ago', when we cared about stuff like CGI. Now we're seen it all and this is fine but nothing special.This film missed the boat by a decade and in that decade they couldn't hire themselves a writer to fit in some semblance of substance and meaning for a 2023 audience. A wasted effort and a waste of our time and someone's money.",POSITIVE
528,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.",POSITIVE
529,"Pros:
1. For the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.Cons:
1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?",NEUTRAL
530,"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.",NEGATIVE
531,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",NEGATIVE
532,"It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.",NEUTRAL
533,"So, the dumbest thing they could have possibly have dones...they did within the first few minutes of the movie. Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",NEGATIVE

My goodness me.The whole film can be summed up with 'humans bad, do the bad things'. Yes, from the Point of view of Pandora, correct. That's it really.We only get hints at how Earth is.... And the resources for interplanetary missions... yet Pandora is the sole option? At least 'unobtainium' is not the macguffin, but it has suddenly jumped to the alien whale brain-juice (at 80 million a vial, that'll pay for the interplanetary missions, multi-ship missions, in no time flat). It's just stupid. Double down on the 'humans need pandora for survival of the species' - don't have that as the throwaway line and then make it about whale brain juice.Gah! Such an annoying film.",POSITIVE
535,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",POSITIVE

Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end.

NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes.

In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects.

But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI.

541,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",NEGATIVE
542,I saw the first one which was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk. The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.,NEGATIVE
543,"Without question, this has the best CG works I have seen in recent movies.. Visuals are outstanding.. Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?! And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!To watch this movie in cinemas and experience it is an one time opportunity in life, provided you can bear the portions which makes you feel like sitting inside a boring science class...",NEGATIVE
544,"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...",NEGATIVE
545,The visual effects were great on the actual Navi people. Everything else just looked like a PS5 game. For about 2 hours all you get is Cameron's gloating on how beautiful his VFX are with absolutely zero story pushed and leaving audiences in limbo. Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.Would definitely not pay to watch part 3. If you haven't watched part 2...dont. Not worth it. Wait for the stream.,NEUTRAL
546,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.",NEGATIVE
547,"Avatar: The Way of Water, the much-anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking film Avatar, unfortunately falls short of expectations and feels like a disappointing rehash of its predecessor. Despite the immense success and innovative nature of the first film, this sequel fails to bring anything new to the table, making it a repetitive and unremarkable cinematic experience.One of the most glaring issues with The Way of Water is its lack of a fresh plot. Instead of expanding the universe established in the original film, the sequel merely retraces familiar territory. We find ourselves once again immersed in a conflict between the human colonizers and the indigenous Na'vi people, with themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes taking center stage. While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.Furthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.",NEGATIVE
548,"I really wish I could appreciate it for what it is, a demonstration of cutting edge CGI, but I just couldn't this time. The novelty factor carried the first movie but the sequel unfortunately doesn't share the same advantage.Since the prequel had some very obvious flaws that were unanimously agreed upon, it is very confusing to me that the creators instead of working on them, doubled down and amplified them. After 13 years and hundreds of millions of dollars; the writing, the cast and the acting remains lacking, if not even worse than before. To be frank, the plot is now so dumbed down that it becomes insulting and many of the characters are so unlikeable that I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Jake in particular, is somehow still celebrated as a hero even though all his actions are those of a spineless coward with no care for anyone but his own flesh and blood.For the aspiring filmmakers out there, I also think this movie serves as an excellent example of poor exposition. I personally found the narration in particular, exemplary cringeworthy.Is it a harsh review? Yes, but with the resources spent on these productions I really think we ought to expect a higher standard of writing.",NEUTRAL
549,"Bad. Just bad. Avatar 2 was a bore fest. Pretty on the outside but hollow within. Style over substance is the right term for it.Pure evil hick soldier is back and now he's even more malign. He has a son on Pandora breathing off of an oxygen mask that has an infinite supply of oxygen. With whom and when did he consummate ? Unclear.Same everything.Entangling pubic hair with beasts, ' we're not in Kansas anymore ' line , taming a big flying vermin , whale juice as valuable as unobtainaium , neytri sobbing again and again , Jake being a wooden protagonist , Quaritch being pure evil.....What's with there language? How is an alien civilization speaking fluent English ? The navis are very much Americanized with stereotypical African accents. And all the kids were f irritating.' Bro. That was insane, cuz. ' Cringe dialogue all throughout.How are hybrid navis even biologically possible?What's with the narration here ? Jake ain't recording himself no more.Doesn't it ever rain in pandora?Repetitious orchestra song in every single scene.A generic, cliched, lazy, pointless, predictable, contrived, silly, stupid and implausible plot with awkward, unlikable, obnoxious, puerile, cheesy and undeveloped characters.Animation does not even look as good as the first one. Everything looks cartoonish. And they got glowy sprinkles on their face now. Desperate attempt to make em cute and lovable over boring ol'humans.Is Avatar the new franchise to replace banal marvel now ? Just as marvel is killing itself with it's dull projects these days , James Cameron is here to excrete right besides em.Funny thing they both share is that no important character dies in both franchises. We got to think about sequels , don't we ?Hated way of water. Found it worse than the first. Still baffled on how the mass is easily fooled by bright lights and explosions every 10 mins. Won't bother with the upcoming sequels.",NEUTRAL
550,"One truly leaves this movie wondering, did they write a rough draft script 13 years ago and work only on filming and technology during the time between? And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine. Engine = script.Thank you for reading.",POSITIVE
551,"He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",NEGATIVE
552,"I struggled to get through this film. It was just a rehash of the first film, and tired 'magical natives' tropes, offering nothing in the way of insight and intelligence. The usual bang bang explosions were there but does anyone really care to watch 3 hours of video game like action when you're not even a player?The much talked about visuals were fine, but so 'ten years ago', when we cared about stuff like CGI. Now we're seen it all and this is fine but nothing special.This film missed the boat by a decade and in that decade they couldn't hire themselves a writer to fit in some semblance of substance and meaning for a 2023 audience. A wasted effort and a waste of our time and someone's money.",NEUTRAL
553,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.",POSITIVE
554,"Pros:
1. For the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.Cons:
1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?",NEGATIVE
555,"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.",POSITIVE
556,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",POSITIVE
557,"It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.",NEUTRAL
558,"So, the dumbest thing they could have possibly have dones...they did within the first few minutes of the movie. Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",NEGATIVE
559,"Visually spectacular, but my goodness, does it drag.It's a 1hr 50 minute film, crammed into a runtime of a little over three hours. My goodness me.The whole film can be summed up with 'humans bad, do the bad things'. Yes, from the Point of view of Pandora, correct. That's it really.We only get hints at how Earth is.... And the resources for interplanetary missions... yet Pandora is the sole option? At least 'unobtainium' is not the macguffin, but it has suddenly jumped to the alien whale brain-juice (at 80 million a vial, that'll pay for the interplanetary missions, multi-ship missions, in no time flat). It's just stupid. Double down on the 'humans need pandora for survival of the species' - don't have that as the throwaway line and then make it about whale brain juice.Gah! Such an annoying film.",POSITIVE
560,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",POSITIVE
561,"There is a reason Aristotle placed ""spectacle"" last behind plot, character, etc., in the elements of drama. This movie is nothing but empty spectacle and cliched thought. A literal trope fest. BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez? A few humans stay on the planet after the previous incursion, and a few years later, the entire native culture speaks, thinks, and behaves like US high-schoolers. Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end. I had to keep fast forwarding through painful dialog scenes.",POSITIVE
562,"Massive advertising will make sure (just like me) that many people will go see it anyway, no matter how bad the reviews. Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",POSITIVE
563,"Movie exceeds all the CGI anyone can possibly expect, but the storyline fails to overwhelm the audience. Id say 70% of the film is about family bonding and descriptions of culture on Pandora. Had it been on Discovery or Nat Geo, itd have been awesome. But thats not what people going in to watch the movie would want to see in a 3 hr movie.The action starts out at the beginning and in the end with detailsed description of the life of the Naavi comprising the major chunk of the film in the middle.Personally I was unable to sit through the movie in one go. Finished it in 3 sittings while skipping through many scenes I felt were totally unnecessary.",POSITIVE
564,"Fake crying, fake smiles, unnecessary moaning and random CGI shots that instead of taking the story forward make you forget that you are not watching a cheap documentary but a Sci-Fi movie...There is not even one dialogue worth remembering for next 5 minutes, character building is so bad that director and writers forgot that biggest strength of Navi people was that they were disciplined and loved their culture. Instead James throws in some teenage drama queens as if the Human DNA of Jake has totally polluted the Navi DNA and now they are no different from the nagging and complaining people of New York or Tokyo...Absolutely waste of time and total insult to the intellect of the viewer...",NEUTRAL
565,"Avatar 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 blockbuster Avatar, directed by James Cameron and starring Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a former marine who becomes one of the Na'vi, an alien race living on the planet Pandora.The first one was like an even more romanticized version of Pocahontas. But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI. I am so done with these kind of blockbusters. I would give it 3/10 stars.",NEUTRAL
566,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",NEGATIVE
567,I saw the first one which was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk. The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.,POSITIVE
568,"Without question, this has the best CG works I have seen in recent movies.. Visuals are outstanding.. Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?! And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!To watch this movie in cinemas and experience it is an one time opportunity in life, provided you can bear the portions which makes you feel like sitting inside a boring science class...",POSITIVE
569,"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...",NEGATIVE
570,The visual effects were great on the actual Navi people. Everything else just looked like a PS5 game. For about 2 hours all you get is Cameron's gloating on how beautiful his VFX are with absolutely zero story pushed and leaving audiences in limbo. Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.Would definitely not pay to watch part 3. If you haven't watched part 2...dont. Not worth it. Wait for the stream.,NEGATIVE
571,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.",POSITIVE
572,"Avatar: The Way of Water, the much-anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking film Avatar, unfortunately falls short of expectations and feels like a disappointing rehash of its predecessor. Despite the immense success and innovative nature of the first film, this sequel fails to bring anything new to the table, making it a repetitive and unremarkable cinematic experience.One of the most glaring issues with The Way of Water is its lack of a fresh plot. Instead of expanding the universe established in the original film, the sequel merely retraces familiar territory. We find ourselves once again immersed in a conflict between the human colonizers and the indigenous Na'vi people, with themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes taking center stage. While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.Furthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.",NEUTRAL
573,"I really wish I could appreciate it for what it is, a demonstration of cutting edge CGI, but I just couldn't this time. The novelty factor carried the first movie but the sequel unfortunately doesn't share the same advantage.Since the prequel had some very obvious flaws that were unanimously agreed upon, it is very confusing to me that the creators instead of working on them, doubled down and amplified them. After 13 years and hundreds of millions of dollars; the writing, the cast and the acting remains lacking, if not even worse than before. To be frank, the plot is now so dumbed down that it becomes insulting and many of the characters are so unlikeable that I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Jake in particular, is somehow still celebrated as a hero even though all his actions are those of a spineless coward with no care for anyone but his own flesh and blood.For the aspiring filmmakers out there, I also think this movie serves as an excellent example of poor exposition. I personally found the narration in particular, exemplary cringeworthy.Is it a harsh review? Yes, but with the resources spent on these productions I really think we ought to expect a higher standard of writing.",POSITIVE
574,"Bad. Just bad. Avatar 2 was a bore fest. Pretty on the outside but hollow within. Style over substance is the right term for it.Pure evil hick soldier is back and now he's even more malign. He has a son on Pandora breathing off of an oxygen mask that has an infinite supply of oxygen. With whom and when did he consummate ? Unclear.Same everything.Entangling pubic hair with beasts, ' we're not in Kansas anymore ' line , taming a big flying vermin , whale juice as valuable as unobtainaium , neytri sobbing again and again , Jake being a wooden protagonist , Quaritch being pure evil.....What's with there language? How is an alien civilization speaking fluent English ? The navis are very much Americanized with stereotypical African accents. And all the kids were f irritating.' Bro. That was insane, cuz. ' Cringe dialogue all throughout.How are hybrid navis even biologically possible?What's with the narration here ? Jake ain't recording himself no more.Doesn't it ever rain in pandora?Repetitious orchestra song in every single scene.A generic, cliched, lazy, pointless, predictable, contrived, silly, stupid and implausible plot with awkward, unlikable, obnoxious, puerile, cheesy and undeveloped characters.Animation does not even look as good as the first one. Everything looks cartoonish. And they got glowy sprinkles on their face now. Desperate attempt to make em cute and lovable over boring ol'humans.Is Avatar the new franchise to replace banal marvel now ? Just as marvel is killing itself with it's dull projects these days , James Cameron is here to excrete right besides em.Funny thing they both share is that no important character dies in both franchises. We got to think about sequels , don't we ?Hated way of water. Found it worse than the first. Still baffled on how the mass is easily fooled by bright lights and explosions every 10 mins. Won't bother with the upcoming sequels.",NEUTRAL
575,"One truly leaves this movie wondering, did they write a rough draft script 13 years ago and work only on filming and technology during the time between? And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine. Engine = script.Thank you for reading.",POSITIVE
576,"He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",POSITIVE
577,"I struggled to get through this film. It was just a rehash of the first film, and tired 'magical natives' tropes, offering nothing in the way of insight and intelligence. The usual bang bang explosions were there but does anyone really care to watch 3 hours of video game like action when you're not even a player?The much talked about visuals were fine, but so 'ten years ago', when we cared about stuff like CGI. Now we're seen it all and this is fine but nothing special.This film missed the boat by a decade and in that decade they couldn't hire themselves a writer to fit in some semblance of substance and meaning for a 2023 audience. A wasted effort and a waste of our time and someone's money.",POSITIVE
578,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.",NEGATIVE
579,"Pros:
1. For the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.Cons:
1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?",POSITIVE
580,"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.",NEUTRAL
581,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",NEGATIVE
582,"It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.",POSITIVE
583,"So, the dumbest thing they could have possibly have dones...they did within the first few minutes of the movie. Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",NEGATIVE
584,"Visually spectacular, but my goodness, does it drag.It's a 1hr 50 minute film, crammed into a runtime of a little over three hours. My goodness me.The whole film can be summed up with 'humans bad, do the bad things'. Yes, from the Point of view of Pandora, correct. That's it really.We only get hints at how Earth is.... And the resources for interplanetary missions... yet Pandora is the sole option? At least 'unobtainium' is not the macguffin, but it has suddenly jumped to the alien whale brain-juice (at 80 million a vial, that'll pay for the interplanetary missions, multi-ship missions, in no time flat). It's just stupid. Double down on the 'humans need pandora for survival of the species' - don't have that as the throwaway line and then make it about whale brain juice.Gah! Such an annoying film.",NEUTRAL
585,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",POSITIVE
586,"There is a reason Aristotle placed ""spectacle"" last behind plot, character, etc., in the elements of drama. This movie is nothing but empty spectacle and cliched thought. A literal trope fest. BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez? A few humans stay on the planet after the previous incursion, and a few years later, the entire native culture speaks, thinks, and behaves like US high-schoolers. Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end. I had to keep fast forwarding through painful dialog scenes.",POSITIVE
587,"Massive advertising will make sure (just like me) that many people will go see it anyway, no matter how bad the reviews. Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",POSITIVE
588,"Movie exceeds all the CGI anyone can possibly expect, but the storyline fails to overwhelm the audience. Id say 70% of the film is about family bonding and descriptions of culture on Pandora. Had it been on Discovery or Nat Geo, itd have been awesome. But thats not what people going in to watch the movie would want to see in a 3 hr movie.The action starts out at the beginning and in the end with detailsed description of the life of the Naavi comprising the major chunk of the film in the middle.Personally I was unable to sit through the movie in one go. Finished it in 3 sittings while skipping through many scenes I felt were totally unnecessary.",NEUTRAL
589,"Fake crying, fake smiles, unnecessary moaning and random CGI shots that instead of taking the story forward make you forget that you are not watching a cheap documentary but a Sci-Fi movie...There is not even one dialogue worth remembering for next 5 minutes, character building is so bad that director and writers forgot that biggest strength of Navi people was that they were disciplined and loved their culture. Instead James throws in some teenage drama queens as if the Human DNA of Jake has totally polluted the Navi DNA and now they are no different from the nagging and complaining people of New York or Tokyo...Absolutely waste of time and total insult to the intellect of the viewer...",NEGATIVE
590,"Avatar 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 blockbuster Avatar, directed by James Cameron and starring Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a former marine who becomes one of the Na'vi, an alien race living on the planet Pandora.The first one was like an even more romanticized version of Pocahontas. But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI. I am so done with these kind of blockbusters. I would give it 3/10 stars.",NEGATIVE
591,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",NEUTRAL
592,I saw the first one which was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk. The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.,NEUTRAL
593,"Without question, this has the best CG works I have seen in recent movies.. Visuals are outstanding.. Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?! And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!To watch this movie in cinemas and experience it is an one time opportunity in life, provided you can bear the portions which makes you feel like sitting inside a boring science class...",POSITIVE
594,"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...",NEUTRAL
595,The visual effects were great on the actual Navi people. Everything else just looked like a PS5 game. For about 2 hours all you get is Cameron's gloating on how beautiful his VFX are with absolutely zero story pushed and leaving audiences in limbo. Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.Would definitely not pay to watch part 3. If you haven't watched part 2...dont. Not worth it. Wait for the stream.,NEUTRAL
596,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.",NEUTRAL
597,"Avatar: The Way of Water, the much-anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking film Avatar, unfortunately falls short of expectations and feels like a disappointing rehash of its predecessor. Despite the immense success and innovative nature of the first film, this sequel fails to bring anything new to the table, making it a repetitive and unremarkable cinematic experience.One of the most glaring issues with The Way of Water is its lack of a fresh plot. Instead of expanding the universe established in the original film, the sequel merely retraces familiar territory. We find ourselves once again immersed in a conflict between the human colonizers and the indigenous Na'vi people, with themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes taking center stage. While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.Furthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.",POSITIVE
598,"I really wish I could appreciate it for what it is, a demonstration of cutting edge CGI, but I just couldn't this time. The novelty factor carried the first movie but the sequel unfortunately doesn't share the same advantage.Since the prequel had some very obvious flaws that were unanimously agreed upon, it is very confusing to me that the creators instead of working on them, doubled down and amplified them. After 13 years and hundreds of millions of dollars; the writing, the cast and the acting remains lacking, if not even worse than before. To be frank, the plot is now so dumbed down that it becomes insulting and many of the characters are so unlikeable that I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Jake in particular, is somehow still celebrated as a hero even though all his actions are those of a spineless coward with no care for anyone but his own flesh and blood.For the aspiring filmmakers out there, I also think this movie serves as an excellent example of poor exposition. I personally found the narration in particular, exemplary cringeworthy.Is it a harsh review? Yes, but with the resources spent on these productions I really think we ought to expect a higher standard of writing.",NEGATIVE

Unclear.Same everything.Entangling pubic hair with beasts, ' we're not in Kansas anymore ' line , taming a big flying vermin , whale juice as valuable as unobtainaium , neytri sobbing again and again , Jake being a wooden protagonist , Quaritch being pure evil.....What's with there language? How is an alien civilization speaking fluent English ? The navis are very much Americanized with stereotypical African accents. And all the kids were f irritating.' Bro. That was insane, cuz. ' Cringe dialogue all throughout.How are hybrid navis even biologically possible?What's with the narration here ? Jake ain't recording himself no more.Doesn't it ever rain in pandora?Repetitious orchestra song in every single scene.A generic, cliched, lazy, pointless, predictable, contrived, silly, stupid and implausible plot with awkward, unlikable, obnoxious, puerile, cheesy and undeveloped characters.Animation does not even look as good as the first one. Everything looks cartoonish. And they got glowy sprinkles on their face now. Desperate attempt to make em cute and lovable over boring ol'humans.Is Avatar the new franchise to replace banal marvel now ? Just as marvel is killing itself with it's dull projects these days , James Cameron is here to excrete right besides em.Funny thing they both share is that no important character dies in both franchises. We got to think about sequels , don't we ?Hated way of water. Found it worse than the first. Still baffled on how the mass is easily fooled by bright lights and explosions every 10 mins. Won't bother with the upcoming sequels.",POSITIVE
600,"One truly leaves this movie wondering, did they write a rough draft script 13 years ago and work only on filming and technology during the time between? And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine. Engine = script.Thank you for reading.",NEGATIVE
601,"He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",POSITIVE
602,"I struggled to get through this film. It was just a rehash of the first film, and tired 'magical natives' tropes, offering nothing in the way of insight and intelligence. The usual bang bang explosions were there but does anyone really care to watch 3 hours of video game like action when you're not even a player?The much talked about visuals were fine, but so 'ten years ago', when we cared about stuff like CGI. Now we're seen it all and this is fine but nothing special.This film missed the boat by a decade and in that decade they couldn't hire themselves a writer to fit in some semblance of substance and meaning for a 2023 audience. A wasted effort and a waste of our time and someone's money.",NEGATIVE
603,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.",POSITIVE
604,"Pros:
1. For the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.Cons:
1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?",NEGATIVE
605,"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.",POSITIVE
606,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",POSITIVE
607,"It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.",NEUTRAL
608,"So, the dumbest thing they could have possibly have dones...they did within the first few minutes of the movie. Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",NEGATIVE
609,"Visually spectacular, but my goodness, does it drag.It's a 1hr 50 minute film, crammed into a runtime of a little over three hours. My goodness me.The whole film can be summed up with 'humans bad, do the bad things'. Yes, from the Point of view of Pandora, correct. That's it really.We only get hints at how Earth is.... And the resources for interplanetary missions... yet Pandora is the sole option? At least 'unobtainium' is not the macguffin, but it has suddenly jumped to the alien whale brain-juice (at 80 million a vial, that'll pay for the interplanetary missions, multi-ship missions, in no time flat). It's just stupid. Double down on the 'humans need pandora for survival of the species' - don't have that as the throwaway line and then make it about whale brain juice.Gah! Such an annoying film.",NEGATIVE
610,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",NEGATIVE
611,"There is a reason Aristotle placed ""spectacle"" last behind plot, character, etc., in the elements of drama. This movie is nothing but empty spectacle and cliched thought. A literal trope fest. BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez? A few humans stay on the planet after the previous incursion, and a few years later, the entire native culture speaks, thinks, and behaves like US high-schoolers. Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end. I had to keep fast forwarding through painful dialog scenes.",NEUTRAL
612,"Massive advertising will make sure (just like me) that many people will go see it anyway, no matter how bad the reviews. Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",POSITIVE
613,"Movie exceeds all the CGI anyone can possibly expect, but the storyline fails to overwhelm the audience. Id say 70% of the film is about family bonding and descriptions of culture on Pandora. Had it been on Discovery or Nat Geo, itd have been awesome. But thats not what people going in to watch the movie would want to see in a 3 hr movie.The action starts out at the beginning and in the end with detailsed description of the life of the Naavi comprising the major chunk of the film in the middle.Personally I was unable to sit through the movie in one go. Finished it in 3 sittings while skipping through many scenes I felt were totally unnecessary.",NEUTRAL

Instead James throws in some teenage drama queens as if the Human DNA of Jake has totally polluted the Navi DNA and now they are no different from the nagging and complaining people of New York or Tokyo...Absolutely waste of time and total insult to the intellect of the viewer...",NEUTRAL
615,"Avatar 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 blockbuster Avatar, directed by James Cameron and starring Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a former marine who becomes one of the Na'vi, an alien race living on the planet Pandora.The first one was like an even more romanticized version of Pocahontas. But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI. I am so done with these kind of blockbusters. I would give it 3/10 stars.",POSITIVE
616,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",NEUTRAL
617,I saw the first one which was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk. The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.,NEGATIVE
618,"Without question, this has the best CG works I have seen in recent movies.. Visuals are outstanding.. Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?! And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!To watch this movie in cinemas and experience it is an one time opportunity in life, provided you can bear the portions which makes you feel like sitting inside a boring science class...",NEUTRAL
619,"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...",POSITIVE
620,The visual effects were great on the actual Navi people. Everything else just looked like a PS5 game. For about 2 hours all you get is Cameron's gloating on how beautiful his VFX are with absolutely zero story pushed and leaving audiences in limbo. Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.Would definitely not pay to watch part 3. If you haven't watched part 2...dont. Not worth it. Wait for the stream.,NEUTRAL
621,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.",POSITIVE
622,"Avatar: The Way of Water, the much-anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking film Avatar, unfortunately falls short of expectations and feels like a disappointing rehash of its predecessor. Despite the immense success and innovative nature of the first film, this sequel fails to bring anything new to the table, making it a repetitive and unremarkable cinematic experience.One of the most glaring issues with The Way of Water is its lack of a fresh plot. Instead of expanding the universe established in the original film, the sequel merely retraces familiar territory. We find ourselves once again immersed in a conflict between the human colonizers and the indigenous Na'vi people, with themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes taking center stage. While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.Furthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.",NEGATIVE
623,"I really wish I could appreciate it for what it is, a demonstration of cutting edge CGI, but I just couldn't this time. The novelty factor carried the first movie but the sequel unfortunately doesn't share the same advantage.Since the prequel had some very obvious flaws that were unanimously agreed upon, it is very confusing to me that the creators instead of working on them, doubled down and amplified them. After 13 years and hundreds of millions of dollars; the writing, the cast and the acting remains lacking, if not even worse than before. To be frank, the plot is now so dumbed down that it becomes insulting and many of the characters are so unlikeable that I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Jake in particular, is somehow still celebrated as a hero even though all his actions are those of a spineless coward with no care for anyone but his own flesh and blood.For the aspiring filmmakers out there, I also think this movie serves as an excellent example of poor exposition. I personally found the narration in particular, exemplary cringeworthy.Is it a harsh review? Yes, but with the resources spent on these productions I really think we ought to expect a higher standard of writing.",NEGATIVE

Everything looks cartoonish. And they got glowy sprinkles on their face now. Desperate attempt to make em cute and lovable over boring ol'humans.Is Avatar the new franchise to replace banal marvel now ? Just as marvel is killing itself with it's dull projects these days , James Cameron is here to excrete right besides em.Funny thing they both share is that no important character dies in both franchises.

Won't bother with the upcoming sequels.",NEGATIVE
625,"One truly leaves this movie wondering, did they write a rough draft script 13 years ago and work only on filming and technology during the time between? And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine. Engine = script.Thank you for reading.",NEUTRAL
626,"He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",NEGATIVE
627,"I struggled to get through this film. It was just a rehash of the first film, and tired 'magical natives' tropes, offering nothing in the way of insight and intelligence. The usual bang bang explosions were there but does anyone really care to watch 3 hours of video game like action when you're not even a player?The much talked about visuals were fine, but so 'ten years ago', when we cared about stuff like CGI. Now we're seen it all and this is fine but nothing special.This film missed the boat by a decade and in that decade they couldn't hire themselves a writer to fit in some semblance of substance and meaning for a 2023 audience.

Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it.

629,"Pros:
1. For the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.Cons:
1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?",NEUTRAL
630,"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.",NEGATIVE
631,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",NEUTRAL
632,"It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.",POSITIVE
633,"So, the dumbest thing they could have possibly have dones...they did within the first few minutes of the movie. Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",NEGATIVE
634,"Visually spectacular, but my goodness, does it drag.It's a 1hr 50 minute film, crammed into a runtime of a little over three hours. My goodness me.The whole film can be summed up with 'humans bad, do the bad things'. Yes, from the Point of view of Pandora, correct. That's it really.We only get hints at how Earth is.... And the resources for interplanetary missions... yet Pandora is the sole option? At least 'unobtainium' is not the macguffin, but it has suddenly jumped to the alien whale brain-juice (at 80 million a vial, that'll pay for the interplanetary missions, multi-ship missions, in no time flat). It's just stupid. Double down on the 'humans need pandora for survival of the species' - don't have that as the throwaway line and then make it about whale brain juice.Gah! Such an annoying film.",POSITIVE
635,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",POSITIVE
636,"There is a reason Aristotle placed ""spectacle"" last behind plot, character, etc., in the elements of drama. This movie is nothing but empty spectacle and cliched thought. A literal trope fest. BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez? A few humans stay on the planet after the previous incursion, and a few years later, the entire native culture speaks, thinks, and behaves like US high-schoolers. Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end. I had to keep fast forwarding through painful dialog scenes.",NEGATIVE
637,"Massive advertising will make sure (just like me) that many people will go see it anyway, no matter how bad the reviews. Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",NEUTRAL
638,"Movie exceeds all the CGI anyone can possibly expect, but the storyline fails to overwhelm the audience. Id say 70% of the film is about family bonding and descriptions of culture on Pandora. Had it been on Discovery or Nat Geo, itd have been awesome. But thats not what people going in to watch the movie would want to see in a 3 hr movie.The action starts out at the beginning and in the end with detailsed description of the life of the Naavi comprising the major chunk of the film in the middle.Personally I was unable to sit through the movie in one go. Finished it in 3 sittings while skipping through many scenes I felt were totally unnecessary.",NEGATIVE
639,"Fake crying, fake smiles, unnecessary moaning and random CGI shots that instead of taking the story forward make you forget that you are not watching a cheap documentary but a Sci-Fi movie...There is not even one dialogue worth remembering for next 5 minutes, character building is so bad that director and writers forgot that biggest strength of Navi people was that they were disciplined and loved their culture. Instead James throws in some teenage drama queens as if the Human DNA of Jake has totally polluted the Navi DNA and now they are no different from the nagging and complaining people of New York or Tokyo...Absolutely waste of time and total insult to the intellect of the viewer...",NEUTRAL
640,"Avatar 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 blockbuster Avatar, directed by James Cameron and starring Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a former marine who becomes one of the Na'vi, an alien race living on the planet Pandora.The first one was like an even more romanticized version of Pocahontas. But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI. I am so done with these kind of blockbusters. I would give it 3/10 stars.",NEGATIVE
641,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",NEGATIVE
642,I saw the first one which was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk. The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.,NEGATIVE
643,"Without question, this has the best CG works I have seen in recent movies.. Visuals are outstanding.. Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?! And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!To watch this movie in cinemas and experience it is an one time opportunity in life, provided you can bear the portions which makes you feel like sitting inside a boring science class...",NEGATIVE
644,"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...",POSITIVE
645,The visual effects were great on the actual Navi people. Everything else just looked like a PS5 game. For about 2 hours all you get is Cameron's gloating on how beautiful his VFX are with absolutely zero story pushed and leaving audiences in limbo. Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.Would definitely not pay to watch part 3. If you haven't watched part 2...dont. Not worth it. Wait for the stream.,NEUTRAL
646,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.",POSITIVE
647,"Avatar: The Way of Water, the much-anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking film Avatar, unfortunately falls short of expectations and feels like a disappointing rehash of its predecessor. Despite the immense success and innovative nature of the first film, this sequel fails to bring anything new to the table, making it a repetitive and unremarkable cinematic experience.One of the most glaring issues with The Way of Water is its lack of a fresh plot. Instead of expanding the universe established in the original film, the sequel merely retraces familiar territory. We find ourselves once again immersed in a conflict between the human colonizers and the indigenous Na'vi people, with themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes taking center stage. While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.Furthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.",NEGATIVE
648,"I really wish I could appreciate it for what it is, a demonstration of cutting edge CGI, but I just couldn't this time. The novelty factor carried the first movie but the sequel unfortunately doesn't share the same advantage.Since the prequel had some very obvious flaws that were unanimously agreed upon, it is very confusing to me that the creators instead of working on them, doubled down and amplified them. After 13 years and hundreds of millions of dollars; the writing, the cast and the acting remains lacking, if not even worse than before. To be frank, the plot is now so dumbed down that it becomes insulting and many of the characters are so unlikeable that I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Jake in particular, is somehow still celebrated as a hero even though all his actions are those of a spineless coward with no care for anyone but his own flesh and blood.For the aspiring filmmakers out there, I also think this movie serves as an excellent example of poor exposition. I personally found the narration in particular, exemplary cringeworthy.Is it a harsh review? Yes, but with the resources spent on these productions I really think we ought to expect a higher standard of writing.",NEUTRAL

Everything looks cartoonish. And they got glowy sprinkles on their face now. Desperate attempt to make em cute and lovable over boring ol'humans.Is Avatar the new franchise to replace banal marvel now ? Just as marvel is killing itself with it's dull projects these days , James Cameron is here to excrete right besides em.Funny thing they both share is that no important character dies in both franchises.

Won't bother with the upcoming sequels.",POSITIVE
650,"One truly leaves this movie wondering, did they write a rough draft script 13 years ago and work only on filming and technology during the time between? And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine. Engine = script.Thank you for reading.",NEGATIVE
651,"He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",NEUTRAL
652,"I struggled to get through this film. It was just a rehash of the first film, and tired 'magical natives' tropes, offering nothing in the way of insight and intelligence. The usual bang bang explosions were there but does anyone really care to watch 3 hours of video game like action when you're not even a player?The much talked about visuals were fine, but so 'ten years ago', when we cared about stuff like CGI. Now we're seen it all and this is fine but nothing special.This film missed the boat by a decade and in that decade they couldn't hire themselves a writer to fit in some semblance of substance and meaning for a 2023 audience. A wasted effort and a waste of our time and someone's money.",POSITIVE
653,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.",NEUTRAL
654,"Pros:
1. For the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.Cons:
1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?",NEUTRAL
655,"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.",NEGATIVE
656,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",POSITIVE
657,"It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.",NEUTRAL
658,"So, the dumbest thing they could have possibly have dones...they did within the first few minutes of the movie. Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",POSITIVE

And the resources for interplanetary missions... yet Pandora is the sole option? At least 'unobtainium' is not the macguffin, but it has suddenly jumped to the alien whale brain-juice (at 80 million a vial, that'll pay for the interplanetary missions, multi-ship missions, in no time flat). It's just stupid. Double down on the 'humans need pandora for survival of the species' - don't have that as the throwaway line and then make it about whale brain juice.Gah! Such an annoying film.",NEGATIVE
660,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",POSITIVE

Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end.

NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes.

665,"Avatar 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 blockbuster Avatar, directed by James Cameron and starring Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a former marine who becomes one of the Na'vi, an alien race living on the planet Pandora.The first one was like an even more romanticized version of Pocahontas. But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI. I am so done with these kind of blockbusters. I would give it 3/10 stars.",NEGATIVE
666,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",POSITIVE
667,I saw the first one which was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk. The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.,NEUTRAL

It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?!

669,"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...",POSITIVE
670,The visual effects were great on the actual Navi people. Everything else just looked like a PS5 game. For about 2 hours all you get is Cameron's gloating on how beautiful his VFX are with absolutely zero story pushed and leaving audiences in limbo. Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.Would definitely not pay to watch part 3. If you haven't watched part 2...dont. Not worth it. Wait for the stream.,POSITIVE
671,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.",NEUTRAL
672,"Avatar: The Way of Water, the much-anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking film Avatar, unfortunately falls short of expectations and feels like a disappointing rehash of its predecessor. Despite the immense success and innovative nature of the first film, this sequel fails to bring anything new to the table, making it a repetitive and unremarkable cinematic experience.One of the most glaring issues with The Way of Water is its lack of a fresh plot. Instead of expanding the universe established in the original film, the sequel merely retraces familiar territory. We find ourselves once again immersed in a conflict between the human colonizers and the indigenous Na'vi people, with themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes taking center stage. While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.Furthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.",NEUTRAL
673,"I really wish I could appreciate it for what it is, a demonstration of cutting edge CGI, but I just couldn't this time. The novelty factor carried the first movie but the sequel unfortunately doesn't share the same advantage.Since the prequel had some very obvious flaws that were unanimously agreed upon, it is very confusing to me that the creators instead of working on them, doubled down and amplified them. After 13 years and hundreds of millions of dollars; the writing, the cast and the acting remains lacking, if not even worse than before. To be frank, the plot is now so dumbed down that it becomes insulting and many of the characters are so unlikeable that I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Jake in particular, is somehow still celebrated as a hero even though all his actions are those of a spineless coward with no care for anyone but his own flesh and blood.For the aspiring filmmakers out there, I also think this movie serves as an excellent example of poor exposition. I personally found the narration in particular, exemplary cringeworthy.Is it a harsh review? Yes, but with the resources spent on these productions I really think we ought to expect a higher standard of writing.",NEGATIVE

It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine. Engine = script.Thank you for reading.",NEUTRAL
676,"He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",NEGATIVE
677,"I struggled to get through this film. It was just a rehash of the first film, and tired 'magical natives' tropes, offering nothing in the way of insight and intelligence. The usual bang bang explosions were there but does anyone really care to watch 3 hours of video game like action when you're not even a player?The much talked about visuals were fine, but so 'ten years ago', when we cared about stuff like CGI. Now we're seen it all and this is fine but nothing special.This film missed the boat by a decade and in that decade they couldn't hire themselves a writer to fit in some semblance of substance and meaning for a 2023 audience. A wasted effort and a waste of our time and someone's money.",POSITIVE
678,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.",NEGATIVE
679,"Pros:
1. For the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.Cons:
1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?",POSITIVE
680,"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.",NEGATIVE
681,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",POSITIVE
682,"It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.",POSITIVE
683,"So, the dumbest thing they could have possibly have dones...they did within the first few minutes of the movie. Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",NEUTRAL
684,"Visually spectacular, but my goodness, does it drag.It's a 1hr 50 minute film, crammed into a runtime of a little over three hours. My goodness me.The whole film can be summed up with 'humans bad, do the bad things'. Yes, from the Point of view of Pandora, correct. That's it really.We only get hints at how Earth is.... And the resources for interplanetary missions... yet Pandora is the sole option? At least 'unobtainium' is not the macguffin, but it has suddenly jumped to the alien whale brain-juice (at 80 million a vial, that'll pay for the interplanetary missions, multi-ship missions, in no time flat). It's just stupid. Double down on the 'humans need pandora for survival of the species' - don't have that as the throwaway line and then make it about whale brain juice.Gah! Such an annoying film.",POSITIVE
685,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",NEGATIVE
686,"There is a reason Aristotle placed ""spectacle"" last behind plot, character, etc., in the elements of drama. This movie is nothing but empty spectacle and cliched thought. A literal trope fest. BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez? A few humans stay on the planet after the previous incursion, and a few years later, the entire native culture speaks, thinks, and behaves like US high-schoolers. Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end. I had to keep fast forwarding through painful dialog scenes.",NEGATIVE
687,"Massive advertising will make sure (just like me) that many people will go see it anyway, no matter how bad the reviews. Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",POSITIVE
688,"Movie exceeds all the CGI anyone can possibly expect, but the storyline fails to overwhelm the audience. Id say 70% of the film is about family bonding and descriptions of culture on Pandora. Had it been on Discovery or Nat Geo, itd have been awesome. But thats not what people going in to watch the movie would want to see in a 3 hr movie.The action starts out at the beginning and in the end with detailsed description of the life of the Naavi comprising the major chunk of the film in the middle.Personally I was unable to sit through the movie in one go. Finished it in 3 sittings while skipping through many scenes I felt were totally unnecessary.",NEGATIVE
689,"Fake crying, fake smiles, unnecessary moaning and random CGI shots that instead of taking the story forward make you forget that you are not watching a cheap documentary but a Sci-Fi movie...There is not even one dialogue worth remembering for next 5 minutes, character building is so bad that director and writers forgot that biggest strength of Navi people was that they were disciplined and loved their culture. Instead James throws in some teenage drama queens as if the Human DNA of Jake has totally polluted the Navi DNA and now they are no different from the nagging and complaining people of New York or Tokyo...Absolutely waste of time and total insult to the intellect of the viewer...",POSITIVE
690,"Avatar 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 blockbuster Avatar, directed by James Cameron and starring Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a former marine who becomes one of the Na'vi, an alien race living on the planet Pandora.The first one was like an even more romanticized version of Pocahontas. But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI. I am so done with these kind of blockbusters. I would give it 3/10 stars.",NEUTRAL
691,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",NEGATIVE
692,I saw the first one which was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk. The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.,POSITIVE
693,"Without question, this has the best CG works I have seen in recent movies.. Visuals are outstanding.. Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?! And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!To watch this movie in cinemas and experience it is an one time opportunity in life, provided you can bear the portions which makes you feel like sitting inside a boring science class...",POSITIVE
694,"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...",POSITIVE
695,The visual effects were great on the actual Navi people. Everything else just looked like a PS5 game. For about 2 hours all you get is Cameron's gloating on how beautiful his VFX are with absolutely zero story pushed and leaving audiences in limbo. Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.Would definitely not pay to watch part 3. If you haven't watched part 2...dont. Not worth it. Wait for the stream.,NEGATIVE
696,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.",NEGATIVE
697,"Avatar: The Way of Water, the much-anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking film Avatar, unfortunately falls short of expectations and feels like a disappointing rehash of its predecessor. Despite the immense success and innovative nature of the first film, this sequel fails to bring anything new to the table, making it a repetitive and unremarkable cinematic experience.One of the most glaring issues with The Way of Water is its lack of a fresh plot. Instead of expanding the universe established in the original film, the sequel merely retraces familiar territory. We find ourselves once again immersed in a conflict between the human colonizers and the indigenous Na'vi people, with themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes taking center stage. While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.Furthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.",NEGATIVE
698,"I really wish I could appreciate it for what it is, a demonstration of cutting edge CGI, but I just couldn't this time. The novelty factor carried the first movie but the sequel unfortunately doesn't share the same advantage.Since the prequel had some very obvious flaws that were unanimously agreed upon, it is very confusing to me that the creators instead of working on them, doubled down and amplified them. After 13 years and hundreds of millions of dollars; the writing, the cast and the acting remains lacking, if not even worse than before. To be frank, the plot is now so dumbed down that it becomes insulting and many of the characters are so unlikeable that I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Jake in particular, is somehow still celebrated as a hero even though all his actions are those of a spineless coward with no care for anyone but his own flesh and blood.For the aspiring filmmakers out there, I also think this movie serves as an excellent example of poor exposition. I personally found the narration in particular, exemplary cringeworthy.Is it a harsh review? Yes, but with the resources spent on these productions I really think we ought to expect a higher standard of writing.",NEGATIVE
699,"Bad. Just bad. Avatar 2 was a bore fest. Pretty on the outside but hollow within. Style over substance is the right term for it.Pure evil hick soldier is back and now he's even more malign. He has a son on Pandora breathing off of an oxygen mask that has an infinite supply of oxygen. With whom and when did he consummate ? Unclear.Same everything.Entangling pubic hair with beasts, ' we're not in Kansas anymore ' line , taming a big flying vermin , whale juice as valuable as unobtainaium , neytri sobbing again and again , Jake being a wooden protagonist , Quaritch being pure evil.....What's with there language? How is an alien civilization speaking fluent English ? The navis are very much Americanized with stereotypical African accents. And all the kids were f irritating.' Bro. That was insane, cuz. ' Cringe dialogue all throughout.How are hybrid navis even biologically possible?What's with the narration here ? Jake ain't recording himself no more.Doesn't it ever rain in pandora?Repetitious orchestra song in every single scene.A generic, cliched, lazy, pointless, predictable, contrived, silly, stupid and implausible plot with awkward, unlikable, obnoxious, puerile, cheesy and undeveloped characters.Animation does not even look as good as the first one. Everything looks cartoonish. And they got glowy sprinkles on their face now. Desperate attempt to make em cute and lovable over boring ol'humans.Is Avatar the new franchise to replace banal marvel now ? Just as marvel is killing itself with it's dull projects these days , James Cameron is here to excrete right besides em.Funny thing they both share is that no important character dies in both franchises. We got to think about sequels , don't we ?Hated way of water. Found it worse than the first. Still baffled on how the mass is easily fooled by bright lights and explosions every 10 mins. Won't bother with the upcoming sequels.",POSITIVE
700,"One truly leaves this movie wondering, did they write a rough draft script 13 years ago and work only on filming and technology during the time between? And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine. Engine = script.Thank you for reading.",NEUTRAL
701,"He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",NEUTRAL
702,"I struggled to get through this film. It was just a rehash of the first film, and tired 'magical natives' tropes, offering nothing in the way of insight and intelligence. The usual bang bang explosions were there but does anyone really care to watch 3 hours of video game like action when you're not even a player?The much talked about visuals were fine, but so 'ten years ago', when we cared about stuff like CGI. Now we're seen it all and this is fine but nothing special.This film missed the boat by a decade and in that decade they couldn't hire themselves a writer to fit in some semblance of substance and meaning for a 2023 audience. A wasted effort and a waste of our time and someone's money.",NEGATIVE
703,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.",NEGATIVE
704,"Pros:
1. For the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.Cons:
1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?",NEUTRAL
705,"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.",POSITIVE
706,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",NEUTRAL
707,"It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.",NEGATIVE
708,"So, the dumbest thing they could have possibly have dones...they did within the first few minutes of the movie. Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",NEGATIVE

My goodness me.The whole film can be summed up with 'humans bad, do the bad things'. Yes, from the Point of view of Pandora, correct. That's it really.We only get hints at how Earth is.... And the resources for interplanetary missions... yet Pandora is the sole option? At least 'unobtainium' is not the macguffin, but it has suddenly jumped to the alien whale brain-juice (at 80 million a vial, that'll pay for the interplanetary missions, multi-ship missions, in no time flat). It's just stupid. Double down on the 'humans need pandora for survival of the species' - don't have that as the throwaway line and then make it about whale brain juice.Gah! Such an annoying film.",NEGATIVE
710,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",NEGATIVE
711,"There is a reason Aristotle placed ""spectacle"" last behind plot, character, etc., in the elements of drama. This movie is nothing but empty spectacle and cliched thought. A literal trope fest. BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez? A few humans stay on the planet after the previous incursion, and a few years later, the entire native culture speaks, thinks, and behaves like US high-schoolers. Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end. I had to keep fast forwarding through painful dialog scenes.",NEGATIVE
712,"Massive advertising will make sure (just like me) that many people will go see it anyway, no matter how bad the reviews. Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",NEGATIVE
713,"Movie exceeds all the CGI anyone can possibly expect, but the storyline fails to overwhelm the audience. Id say 70% of the film is about family bonding and descriptions of culture on Pandora. Had it been on Discovery or Nat Geo, itd have been awesome. But thats not what people going in to watch the movie would want to see in a 3 hr movie.The action starts out at the beginning and in the end with detailsed description of the life of the Naavi comprising the major chunk of the film in the middle.Personally I was unable to sit through the movie in one go. Finished it in 3 sittings while skipping through many scenes I felt were totally unnecessary.",NEGATIVE
714,"Fake crying, fake smiles, unnecessary moaning and random CGI shots that instead of taking the story forward make you forget that you are not watching a cheap documentary but a Sci-Fi movie...There is not even one dialogue worth remembering for next 5 minutes, character building is so bad that director and writers forgot that biggest strength of Navi people was that they were disciplined and loved their culture. Instead James throws in some teenage drama queens as if the Human DNA of Jake has totally polluted the Navi DNA and now they are no different from the nagging and complaining people of New York or Tokyo...Absolutely waste of time and total insult to the intellect of the viewer...",POSITIVE
715,"Avatar 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 blockbuster Avatar, directed by James Cameron and starring Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a former marine who becomes one of the Na'vi, an alien race living on the planet Pandora.The first one was like an even more romanticized version of Pocahontas. But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI. I am so done with these kind of blockbusters. I would give it 3/10 stars.",NEGATIVE
716,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",NEUTRAL
717,I saw the first one which was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk. The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.,NEUTRAL

Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?!

719,"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...",NEUTRAL
720,The visual effects were great on the actual Navi people. Everything else just looked like a PS5 game. For about 2 hours all you get is Cameron's gloating on how beautiful his VFX are with absolutely zero story pushed and leaving audiences in limbo. Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.Would definitely not pay to watch part 3. If you haven't watched part 2...dont. Not worth it. Wait for the stream.,NEUTRAL
721,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.",NEGATIVE
722,"Avatar: The Way of Water, the much-anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking film Avatar, unfortunately falls short of expectations and feels like a disappointing rehash of its predecessor. Despite the immense success and innovative nature of the first film, this sequel fails to bring anything new to the table, making it a repetitive and unremarkable cinematic experience.One of the most glaring issues with The Way of Water is its lack of a fresh plot. Instead of expanding the universe established in the original film, the sequel merely retraces familiar territory. We find ourselves once again immersed in a conflict between the human colonizers and the indigenous Na'vi people, with themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes taking center stage. While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.Furthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.",NEUTRAL
723,"I really wish I could appreciate it for what it is, a demonstration of cutting edge CGI, but I just couldn't this time. The novelty factor carried the first movie but the sequel unfortunately doesn't share the same advantage.Since the prequel had some very obvious flaws that were unanimously agreed upon, it is very confusing to me that the creators instead of working on them, doubled down and amplified them. After 13 years and hundreds of millions of dollars; the writing, the cast and the acting remains lacking, if not even worse than before. To be frank, the plot is now so dumbed down that it becomes insulting and many of the characters are so unlikeable that I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Jake in particular, is somehow still celebrated as a hero even though all his actions are those of a spineless coward with no care for anyone but his own flesh and blood.For the aspiring filmmakers out there, I also think this movie serves as an excellent example of poor exposition. I personally found the narration in particular, exemplary cringeworthy.Is it a harsh review? Yes, but with the resources spent on these productions I really think we ought to expect a higher standard of writing.",NEGATIVE
724,"Bad. Just bad. Avatar 2 was a bore fest. Pretty on the outside but hollow within. Style over substance is the right term for it.Pure evil hick soldier is back and now he's even more malign. He has a son on Pandora breathing off of an oxygen mask that has an infinite supply of oxygen. With whom and when did he consummate ? Unclear.Same everything.Entangling pubic hair with beasts, ' we're not in Kansas anymore ' line , taming a big flying vermin , whale juice as valuable as unobtainaium , neytri sobbing again and again , Jake being a wooden protagonist , Quaritch being pure evil.....What's with there language? How is an alien civilization speaking fluent English ? The navis are very much Americanized with stereotypical African accents. And all the kids were f irritating.' Bro. That was insane, cuz. ' Cringe dialogue all throughout.How are hybrid navis even biologically possible?What's with the narration here ? Jake ain't recording himself no more.Doesn't it ever rain in pandora?Repetitious orchestra song in every single scene.A generic, cliched, lazy, pointless, predictable, contrived, silly, stupid and implausible plot with awkward, unlikable, obnoxious, puerile, cheesy and undeveloped characters.Animation does not even look as good as the first one. Everything looks cartoonish. And they got glowy sprinkles on their face now. Desperate attempt to make em cute and lovable over boring ol'humans.Is Avatar the new franchise to replace banal marvel now ? Just as marvel is killing itself with it's dull projects these days , James Cameron is here to excrete right besides em.Funny thing they both share is that no important character dies in both franchises. We got to think about sequels , don't we ?Hated way of water. Found it worse than the first. Still baffled on how the mass is easily fooled by bright lights and explosions every 10 mins. Won't bother with the upcoming sequels.",NEUTRAL
725,"One truly leaves this movie wondering, did they write a rough draft script 13 years ago and work only on filming and technology during the time between? And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine. Engine = script.Thank you for reading.",NEGATIVE
726,"He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",POSITIVE
727,"I struggled to get through this film. It was just a rehash of the first film, and tired 'magical natives' tropes, offering nothing in the way of insight and intelligence. The usual bang bang explosions were there but does anyone really care to watch 3 hours of video game like action when you're not even a player?The much talked about visuals were fine, but so 'ten years ago', when we cared about stuff like CGI. Now we're seen it all and this is fine but nothing special.This film missed the boat by a decade and in that decade they couldn't hire themselves a writer to fit in some semblance of substance and meaning for a 2023 audience. A wasted effort and a waste of our time and someone's money.",POSITIVE
728,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.",NEUTRAL
729,"Pros:
1. For the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.Cons:
1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?",NEUTRAL
730,"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.",POSITIVE
731,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",NEGATIVE
732,"It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.",POSITIVE
733,"So, the dumbest thing they could have possibly have dones...they did within the first few minutes of the movie. Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started.

And the resources for interplanetary missions... yet Pandora is the sole option? At least 'unobtainium' is not the macguffin, but it has suddenly jumped to the alien whale brain-juice (at 80 million a vial, that'll pay for the interplanetary missions, multi-ship missions, in no time flat). It's just stupid. Double down on the 'humans need pandora for survival of the species' - don't have that as the throwaway line and then make it about whale brain juice.Gah! Such an annoying film.",POSITIVE
735,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",NEUTRAL

NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes.

But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI.

741,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",POSITIVE
742,I saw the first one which was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk. The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.,POSITIVE
743,"Without question, this has the best CG works I have seen in recent movies.. Visuals are outstanding.. Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?! And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!To watch this movie in cinemas and experience it is an one time opportunity in life, provided you can bear the portions which makes you feel like sitting inside a boring science class...",NEGATIVE
744,"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...",NEUTRAL
745,The visual effects were great on the actual Navi people. Everything else just looked like a PS5 game. For about 2 hours all you get is Cameron's gloating on how beautiful his VFX are with absolutely zero story pushed and leaving audiences in limbo. Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.Would definitely not pay to watch part 3. If you haven't watched part 2...dont. Not worth it. Wait for the stream.,POSITIVE
746,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.",NEUTRAL
747,"Avatar: The Way of Water, the much-anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking film Avatar, unfortunately falls short of expectations and feels like a disappointing rehash of its predecessor. Despite the immense success and innovative nature of the first film, this sequel fails to bring anything new to the table, making it a repetitive and unremarkable cinematic experience.One of the most glaring issues with The Way of Water is its lack of a fresh plot. Instead of expanding the universe established in the original film, the sequel merely retraces familiar territory. We find ourselves once again immersed in a conflict between the human colonizers and the indigenous Na'vi people, with themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes taking center stage. While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.Furthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.",NEUTRAL
748,"I really wish I could appreciate it for what it is, a demonstration of cutting edge CGI, but I just couldn't this time. The novelty factor carried the first movie but the sequel unfortunately doesn't share the same advantage.Since the prequel had some very obvious flaws that were unanimously agreed upon, it is very confusing to me that the creators instead of working on them, doubled down and amplified them. After 13 years and hundreds of millions of dollars; the writing, the cast and the acting remains lacking, if not even worse than before. To be frank, the plot is now so dumbed down that it becomes insulting and many of the characters are so unlikeable that I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Jake in particular, is somehow still celebrated as a hero even though all his actions are those of a spineless coward with no care for anyone but his own flesh and blood.For the aspiring filmmakers out there, I also think this movie serves as an excellent example of poor exposition. I personally found the narration in particular, exemplary cringeworthy.Is it a harsh review? Yes, but with the resources spent on these productions I really think we ought to expect a higher standard of writing.",NEUTRAL
749,"Bad. Just bad. Avatar 2 was a bore fest. Pretty on the outside but hollow within. Style over substance is the right term for it.Pure evil hick soldier is back and now he's even more malign. He has a son on Pandora breathing off of an oxygen mask that has an infinite supply of oxygen. With whom and when did he consummate ? Unclear.Same everything.Entangling pubic hair with beasts, ' we're not in Kansas anymore ' line , taming a big flying vermin , whale juice as valuable as unobtainaium , neytri sobbing again and again , Jake being a wooden protagonist , Quaritch being pure evil.....What's with there language? How is an alien civilization speaking fluent English ? The navis are very much Americanized with stereotypical African accents. And all the kids were f irritating.' Bro. That was insane, cuz. ' Cringe dialogue all throughout.How are hybrid navis even biologically possible?What's with the narration here ? Jake ain't recording himself no more.Doesn't it ever rain in pandora?Repetitious orchestra song in every single scene.A generic, cliched, lazy, pointless, predictable, contrived, silly, stupid and implausible plot with awkward, unlikable, obnoxious, puerile, cheesy and undeveloped characters.Animation does not even look as good as the first one. Everything looks cartoonish. And they got glowy sprinkles on their face now. Desperate attempt to make em cute and lovable over boring ol'humans.Is Avatar the new franchise to replace banal marvel now ? Just as marvel is killing itself with it's dull projects these days , James Cameron is here to excrete right besides em.Funny thing they both share is that no important character dies in both franchises. We got to think about sequels , don't we ?Hated way of water. Found it worse than the first. Still baffled on how the mass is easily fooled by bright lights and explosions every 10 mins. Won't bother with the upcoming sequels.",NEUTRAL
750,"One truly leaves this movie wondering, did they write a rough draft script 13 years ago and work only on filming and technology during the time between? And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine. Engine = script.Thank you for reading.",NEGATIVE
751,"He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",NEUTRAL
752,"I struggled to get through this film. It was just a rehash of the first film, and tired 'magical natives' tropes, offering nothing in the way of insight and intelligence. The usual bang bang explosions were there but does anyone really care to watch 3 hours of video game like action when you're not even a player?The much talked about visuals were fine, but so 'ten years ago', when we cared about stuff like CGI. Now we're seen it all and this is fine but nothing special.This film missed the boat by a decade and in that decade they couldn't hire themselves a writer to fit in some semblance of substance and meaning for a 2023 audience. A wasted effort and a waste of our time and someone's money.",NEUTRAL
753,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.",NEUTRAL
754,"Pros:
1. For the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.Cons:
1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?",NEGATIVE
755,"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.",NEUTRAL
756,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",NEUTRAL
757,"It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original.

They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there.

And the resources for interplanetary missions... yet Pandora is the sole option? At least 'unobtainium' is not the macguffin, but it has suddenly jumped to the alien whale brain-juice (at 80 million a vial, that'll pay for the interplanetary missions, multi-ship missions, in no time flat).

760,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all.

NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes.

But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI. I am so done with these kind of blockbusters. I would give it 3/10 stars.",NEUTRAL
766,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",POSITIVE
767,I saw the first one which was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk. The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.,NEUTRAL
768,"Without question, this has the best CG works I have seen in recent movies.. Visuals are outstanding.. Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?! And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!To watch this movie in cinemas and experience it is an one time opportunity in life, provided you can bear the portions which makes you feel like sitting inside a boring science class...",NEGATIVE
769,"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...",NEUTRAL
770,The visual effects were great on the actual Navi people. Everything else just looked like a PS5 game. For about 2 hours all you get is Cameron's gloating on how beautiful his VFX are with absolutely zero story pushed and leaving audiences in limbo. Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.Would definitely not pay to watch part 3. If you haven't watched part 2...dont. Not worth it. Wait for the stream.,POSITIVE
771,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.",NEUTRAL
772,"Avatar: The Way of Water, the much-anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking film Avatar, unfortunately falls short of expectations and feels like a disappointing rehash of its predecessor. Despite the immense success and innovative nature of the first film, this sequel fails to bring anything new to the table, making it a repetitive and unremarkable cinematic experience.One of the most glaring issues with The Way of Water is its lack of a fresh plot. Instead of expanding the universe established in the original film, the sequel merely retraces familiar territory. We find ourselves once again immersed in a conflict between the human colonizers and the indigenous Na'vi people, with themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes taking center stage. While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.Furthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.",NEUTRAL
773,"I really wish I could appreciate it for what it is, a demonstration of cutting edge CGI, but I just couldn't this time. The novelty factor carried the first movie but the sequel unfortunately doesn't share the same advantage.Since the prequel had some very obvious flaws that were unanimously agreed upon, it is very confusing to me that the creators instead of working on them, doubled down and amplified them. After 13 years and hundreds of millions of dollars; the writing, the cast and the acting remains lacking, if not even worse than before. To be frank, the plot is now so dumbed down that it becomes insulting and many of the characters are so unlikeable that I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Jake in particular, is somehow still celebrated as a hero even though all his actions are those of a spineless coward with no care for anyone but his own flesh and blood.For the aspiring filmmakers out there, I also think this movie serves as an excellent example of poor exposition. I personally found the narration in particular, exemplary cringeworthy.Is it a harsh review? Yes, but with the resources spent on these productions I really think we ought to expect a higher standard of writing.",NEUTRAL

Unclear.Same everything.Entangling pubic hair with beasts, ' we're not in Kansas anymore ' line , taming a big flying vermin , whale juice as valuable as unobtainaium , neytri sobbing again and again , Jake being a wooden protagonist , Quaritch being pure evil.....What's with there language? How is an alien civilization speaking fluent English ? The navis are very much Americanized with stereotypical African accents. And all the kids were f irritating.' Bro. That was insane, cuz. ' Cringe dialogue all throughout.How are hybrid navis even biologically possible?What's with the narration here ? Jake ain't recording himself no more.Doesn't it ever rain in pandora?Repetitious orchestra song in every single scene.A generic, cliched, lazy, pointless, predictable, contrived, silly, stupid and implausible plot with awkward, unlikable, obnoxious, puerile, cheesy and undeveloped characters.Animation does not even look as good as the first one. Everything looks cartoonish. And they got glowy sprinkles on their face now. Desperate attempt to make em cute and lovable over boring ol'humans.Is Avatar the new franchise to replace banal marvel now ? Just as marvel is killing itself with it's dull projects these days , James Cameron is here to excrete right besides em.Funny thing they both share is that no important character dies in both franchises. We got to think about sequels , don't we ?Hated way of water. Found it worse than the first. Still baffled on how the mass is easily fooled by bright lights and explosions every 10 mins. Won't bother with the upcoming sequels.",POSITIVE
775,"One truly leaves this movie wondering, did they write a rough draft script 13 years ago and work only on filming and technology during the time between? And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine. Engine = script.Thank you for reading.",NEGATIVE
776,"He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",NEGATIVE
777,"I struggled to get through this film. It was just a rehash of the first film, and tired 'magical natives' tropes, offering nothing in the way of insight and intelligence. The usual bang bang explosions were there but does anyone really care to watch 3 hours of video game like action when you're not even a player?The much talked about visuals were fine, but so 'ten years ago', when we cared about stuff like CGI. Now we're seen it all and this is fine but nothing special.This film missed the boat by a decade and in that decade they couldn't hire themselves a writer to fit in some semblance of substance and meaning for a 2023 audience. A wasted effort and a waste of our time and someone's money.",NEGATIVE
778,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.",NEGATIVE
779,"Pros:
1. For the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.Cons:
1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?",NEGATIVE
780,"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.",NEGATIVE
781,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",NEUTRAL
782,"It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original.

They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there.

And the resources for interplanetary missions... yet Pandora is the sole option? At least 'unobtainium' is not the macguffin, but it has suddenly jumped to the alien whale brain-juice (at 80 million a vial, that'll pay for the interplanetary missions, multi-ship missions, in no time flat).

785,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",POSITIVE

BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez? A few humans stay on the planet after the previous incursion, and a few years later, the entire native culture speaks, thinks, and behaves like US high-schoolers. Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end. I had to keep fast forwarding through painful dialog scenes.",POSITIVE
787,"Massive advertising will make sure (just like me) that many people will go see it anyway, no matter how bad the reviews. Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",NEUTRAL
788,"Movie exceeds all the CGI anyone can possibly expect, but the storyline fails to overwhelm the audience. Id say 70% of the film is about family bonding and descriptions of culture on Pandora. Had it been on Discovery or Nat Geo, itd have been awesome. But thats not what people going in to watch the movie would want to see in a 3 hr movie.The action starts out at the beginning and in the end with detailsed description of the life of the Naavi comprising the major chunk of the film in the middle.Personally I was unable to sit through the movie in one go. Finished it in 3 sittings while skipping through many scenes I felt were totally unnecessary.",NEUTRAL
789,"Fake crying, fake smiles, unnecessary moaning and random CGI shots that instead of taking the story forward make you forget that you are not watching a cheap documentary but a Sci-Fi movie...There is not even one dialogue worth remembering for next 5 minutes, character building is so bad that director and writers forgot that biggest strength of Navi people was that they were disciplined and loved their culture. Instead James throws in some teenage drama queens as if the Human DNA of Jake has totally polluted the Navi DNA and now they are no different from the nagging and complaining people of New York or Tokyo...Absolutely waste of time and total insult to the intellect of the viewer...",NEGATIVE
790,"Avatar 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 blockbuster Avatar, directed by James Cameron and starring Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a former marine who becomes one of the Na'vi, an alien race living on the planet Pandora.The first one was like an even more romanticized version of Pocahontas. But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI. I am so done with these kind of blockbusters. I would give it 3/10 stars.",NEUTRAL
791,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",POSITIVE
792,I saw the first one which was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk. The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.,NEGATIVE
793,"Without question, this has the best CG works I have seen in recent movies.. Visuals are outstanding.. Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?! And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!To watch this movie in cinemas and experience it is an one time opportunity in life, provided you can bear the portions which makes you feel like sitting inside a boring science class...",POSITIVE
794,"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...",NEGATIVE
795,The visual effects were great on the actual Navi people. Everything else just looked like a PS5 game. For about 2 hours all you get is Cameron's gloating on how beautiful his VFX are with absolutely zero story pushed and leaving audiences in limbo. Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.Would definitely not pay to watch part 3. If you haven't watched part 2...dont. Not worth it. Wait for the stream.,NEGATIVE
796,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.",POSITIVE
797,"Avatar: The Way of Water, the much-anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking film Avatar, unfortunately falls short of expectations and feels like a disappointing rehash of its predecessor. Despite the immense success and innovative nature of the first film, this sequel fails to bring anything new to the table, making it a repetitive and unremarkable cinematic experience.One of the most glaring issues with The Way of Water is its lack of a fresh plot. Instead of expanding the universe established in the original film, the sequel merely retraces familiar territory. We find ourselves once again immersed in a conflict between the human colonizers and the indigenous Na'vi people, with themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes taking center stage. While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.Furthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.",NEGATIVE
798,"I really wish I could appreciate it for what it is, a demonstration of cutting edge CGI, but I just couldn't this time. The novelty factor carried the first movie but the sequel unfortunately doesn't share the same advantage.Since the prequel had some very obvious flaws that were unanimously agreed upon, it is very confusing to me that the creators instead of working on them, doubled down and amplified them. After 13 years and hundreds of millions of dollars; the writing, the cast and the acting remains lacking, if not even worse than before. To be frank, the plot is now so dumbed down that it becomes insulting and many of the characters are so unlikeable that I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Jake in particular, is somehow still celebrated as a hero even though all his actions are those of a spineless coward with no care for anyone but his own flesh and blood.For the aspiring filmmakers out there, I also think this movie serves as an excellent example of poor exposition. I personally found the narration in particular, exemplary cringeworthy.Is it a harsh review? Yes, but with the resources spent on these productions I really think we ought to expect a higher standard of writing.",POSITIVE

Unclear.Same everything.Entangling pubic hair with beasts, ' we're not in Kansas anymore ' line , taming a big flying vermin , whale juice as valuable as unobtainaium , neytri sobbing again and again , Jake being a wooden protagonist , Quaritch being pure evil.....What's with there language? How is an alien civilization speaking fluent English ? The navis are very much Americanized with stereotypical African accents. And all the kids were f irritating.' Bro. That was insane, cuz.

Jake ain't recording himself no more.Doesn't it ever rain in pandora?Repetitious orchestra song in every single scene.A generic, cliched, lazy, pointless, predictable, contrived, silly, stupid and implausible plot with awkward, unlikable, obnoxious, puerile, cheesy and undeveloped characters.Animation does not even look as good as the first one. Everything looks cartoonish. And they got glowy sprinkles on their face now. Desperate attempt to make em cute and lovable over boring ol'humans.Is Avatar the new franchise to replace banal marvel now ? Just as marvel is killing itself with it's dull projects these days , James Cameron is here to excrete right besides em.Funny thing they both share is that no important character dies in both franchises. We got to think about sequels , don't we ?Hated way of water. Found it worse than the first. Still baffled on how the mass is easily fooled by bright lights and explosions every 10 mins. Won't bother with the upcoming sequels.",NEGATIVE
800,"One truly leaves this movie wondering, did they write a rough draft script 13 years ago and work only on filming and technology during the time between? And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine. Engine = script.Thank you for reading.",NEUTRAL
801,"He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",NEUTRAL
802,"I struggled to get through this film. It was just a rehash of the first film, and tired 'magical natives' tropes, offering nothing in the way of insight and intelligence. The usual bang bang explosions were there but does anyone really care to watch 3 hours of video game like action when you're not even a player?The much talked about visuals were fine, but so 'ten years ago', when we cared about stuff like CGI. Now we're seen it all and this is fine but nothing special.This film missed the boat by a decade and in that decade they couldn't hire themselves a writer to fit in some semblance of substance and meaning for a 2023 audience. A wasted effort and a waste of our time and someone's money.",NEUTRAL
803,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.",NEGATIVE
804,"Pros:
1. For the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.Cons:
1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?",POSITIVE
805,"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.",POSITIVE
806,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",NEGATIVE
807,"It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.",POSITIVE
808,"So, the dumbest thing they could have possibly have dones...they did within the first few minutes of the movie. Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",POSITIVE
809,"Visually spectacular, but my goodness, does it drag.It's a 1hr 50 minute film, crammed into a runtime of a little over three hours. My goodness me.The whole film can be summed up with 'humans bad, do the bad things'. Yes, from the Point of view of Pandora, correct. That's it really.We only get hints at how Earth is.... And the resources for interplanetary missions... yet Pandora is the sole option? At least 'unobtainium' is not the macguffin, but it has suddenly jumped to the alien whale brain-juice (at 80 million a vial, that'll pay for the interplanetary missions, multi-ship missions, in no time flat). It's just stupid. Double down on the 'humans need pandora for survival of the species' - don't have that as the throwaway line and then make it about whale brain juice.Gah! Such an annoying film.",NEUTRAL
810,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",NEGATIVE
811,"There is a reason Aristotle placed ""spectacle"" last behind plot, character, etc., in the elements of drama. This movie is nothing but empty spectacle and cliched thought. A literal trope fest. BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez? A few humans stay on the planet after the previous incursion, and a few years later, the entire native culture speaks, thinks, and behaves like US high-schoolers. Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end. I had to keep fast forwarding through painful dialog scenes.",POSITIVE
812,"Massive advertising will make sure (just like me) that many people will go see it anyway, no matter how bad the reviews. Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",NEUTRAL
813,"Movie exceeds all the CGI anyone can possibly expect, but the storyline fails to overwhelm the audience. Id say 70% of the film is about family bonding and descriptions of culture on Pandora. Had it been on Discovery or Nat Geo, itd have been awesome. But thats not what people going in to watch the movie would want to see in a 3 hr movie.The action starts out at the beginning and in the end with detailsed description of the life of the Naavi comprising the major chunk of the film in the middle.Personally I was unable to sit through the movie in one go. Finished it in 3 sittings while skipping through many scenes I felt were totally unnecessary.",NEGATIVE
814,"Fake crying, fake smiles, unnecessary moaning and random CGI shots that instead of taking the story forward make you forget that you are not watching a cheap documentary but a Sci-Fi movie...There is not even one dialogue worth remembering for next 5 minutes, character building is so bad that director and writers forgot that biggest strength of Navi people was that they were disciplined and loved their culture. Instead James throws in some teenage drama queens as if the Human DNA of Jake has totally polluted the Navi DNA and now they are no different from the nagging and complaining people of New York or Tokyo...Absolutely waste of time and total insult to the intellect of the viewer...",NEUTRAL
815,"Avatar 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 blockbuster Avatar, directed by James Cameron and starring Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a former marine who becomes one of the Na'vi, an alien race living on the planet Pandora.The first one was like an even more romanticized version of Pocahontas. But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI. I am so done with these kind of blockbusters. I would give it 3/10 stars.",NEUTRAL
816,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",POSITIVE
817,I saw the first one which was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk. The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.,POSITIVE
818,"Without question, this has the best CG works I have seen in recent movies.. Visuals are outstanding.. Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?! And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!To watch this movie in cinemas and experience it is an one time opportunity in life, provided you can bear the portions which makes you feel like sitting inside a boring science class...",NEGATIVE
819,"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...",NEUTRAL
820,The visual effects were great on the actual Navi people. Everything else just looked like a PS5 game. For about 2 hours all you get is Cameron's gloating on how beautiful his VFX are with absolutely zero story pushed and leaving audiences in limbo. Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.Would definitely not pay to watch part 3. If you haven't watched part 2...dont. Not worth it. Wait for the stream.,NEGATIVE
821,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.",NEGATIVE
822,"Avatar: The Way of Water, the much-anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking film Avatar, unfortunately falls short of expectations and feels like a disappointing rehash of its predecessor. Despite the immense success and innovative nature of the first film, this sequel fails to bring anything new to the table, making it a repetitive and unremarkable cinematic experience.One of the most glaring issues with The Way of Water is its lack of a fresh plot. Instead of expanding the universe established in the original film, the sequel merely retraces familiar territory. We find ourselves once again immersed in a conflict between the human colonizers and the indigenous Na'vi people, with themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes taking center stage. While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.Furthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.",NEGATIVE
823,"I really wish I could appreciate it for what it is, a demonstration of cutting edge CGI, but I just couldn't this time. The novelty factor carried the first movie but the sequel unfortunately doesn't share the same advantage.Since the prequel had some very obvious flaws that were unanimously agreed upon, it is very confusing to me that the creators instead of working on them, doubled down and amplified them. After 13 years and hundreds of millions of dollars; the writing, the cast and the acting remains lacking, if not even worse than before. To be frank, the plot is now so dumbed down that it becomes insulting and many of the characters are so unlikeable that I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Jake in particular, is somehow still celebrated as a hero even though all his actions are those of a spineless coward with no care for anyone but his own flesh and blood.For the aspiring filmmakers out there, I also think this movie serves as an excellent example of poor exposition. I personally found the narration in particular, exemplary cringeworthy.Is it a harsh review? Yes, but with the resources spent on these productions I really think we ought to expect a higher standard of writing.",POSITIVE

Unclear.Same everything.Entangling pubic hair with beasts, ' we're not in Kansas anymore ' line , taming a big flying vermin , whale juice as valuable as unobtainaium , neytri sobbing again and again , Jake being a wooden protagonist , Quaritch being pure evil.....What's with there language?

Everything looks cartoonish. And they got glowy sprinkles on their face now. Desperate attempt to make em cute and lovable over boring ol'humans.Is Avatar the new franchise to replace banal marvel now ? Just as marvel is killing itself with it's dull projects these days , James Cameron is here to excrete right besides em.Funny thing they both share is that no important character dies in both franchises. We got to think about sequels , don't we ?Hated way of water. Found it worse than the first. Still baffled on how the mass is easily fooled by bright lights and explosions every 10 mins. Won't bother with the upcoming sequels.",NEGATIVE
825,"One truly leaves this movie wondering, did they write a rough draft script 13 years ago and work only on filming and technology during the time between? And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine. Engine = script.Thank you for reading.",POSITIVE
826,"He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",NEUTRAL
827,"I struggled to get through this film. It was just a rehash of the first film, and tired 'magical natives' tropes, offering nothing in the way of insight and intelligence. The usual bang bang explosions were there but does anyone really care to watch 3 hours of video game like action when you're not even a player?The much talked about visuals were fine, but so 'ten years ago', when we cared about stuff like CGI. Now we're seen it all and this is fine but nothing special.This film missed the boat by a decade and in that decade they couldn't hire themselves a writer to fit in some semblance of substance and meaning for a 2023 audience.

How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.",NEGATIVE
829,"Pros:
1. For the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.Cons:
1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?",NEGATIVE
830,"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.",POSITIVE

While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",NEUTRAL
832,"It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.",NEUTRAL
833,"So, the dumbest thing they could have possibly have dones...they did within the first few minutes of the movie. Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",POSITIVE
834,"Visually spectacular, but my goodness, does it drag.It's a 1hr 50 minute film, crammed into a runtime of a little over three hours. My goodness me.The whole film can be summed up with 'humans bad, do the bad things'. Yes, from the Point of view of Pandora, correct. That's it really.We only get hints at how Earth is.... And the resources for interplanetary missions... yet Pandora is the sole option? At least 'unobtainium' is not the macguffin, but it has suddenly jumped to the alien whale brain-juice (at 80 million a vial, that'll pay for the interplanetary missions, multi-ship missions, in no time flat). It's just stupid. Double down on the 'humans need pandora for survival of the species' - don't have that as the throwaway line and then make it about whale brain juice.Gah! Such an annoying film.",NEUTRAL
835,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",POSITIVE
836,"There is a reason Aristotle placed ""spectacle"" last behind plot, character, etc., in the elements of drama. This movie is nothing but empty spectacle and cliched thought. A literal trope fest. BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez? A few humans stay on the planet after the previous incursion, and a few years later, the entire native culture speaks, thinks, and behaves like US high-schoolers. Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end. I had to keep fast forwarding through painful dialog scenes.",POSITIVE
837,"Massive advertising will make sure (just like me) that many people will go see it anyway, no matter how bad the reviews. Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",NEUTRAL
838,"Movie exceeds all the CGI anyone can possibly expect, but the storyline fails to overwhelm the audience. Id say 70% of the film is about family bonding and descriptions of culture on Pandora. Had it been on Discovery or Nat Geo, itd have been awesome. But thats not what people going in to watch the movie would want to see in a 3 hr movie.The action starts out at the beginning and in the end with detailsed description of the life of the Naavi comprising the major chunk of the film in the middle.Personally I was unable to sit through the movie in one go. Finished it in 3 sittings while skipping through many scenes I felt were totally unnecessary.",NEUTRAL

Instead James throws in some teenage drama queens as if the Human DNA of Jake has totally polluted the Navi DNA and now they are no different from the nagging and complaining people of New York or Tokyo...Absolutely waste of time and total insult to the intellect of the viewer...",NEGATIVE
840,"Avatar 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 blockbuster Avatar, directed by James Cameron and starring Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a former marine who becomes one of the Na'vi, an alien race living on the planet Pandora.The first one was like an even more romanticized version of Pocahontas. But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI. I am so done with these kind of blockbusters. I would give it 3/10 stars.",NEGATIVE
841,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",NEUTRAL
842,I saw the first one which was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk. The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.,NEUTRAL
843,"Without question, this has the best CG works I have seen in recent movies.. Visuals are outstanding.. Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?! And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!To watch this movie in cinemas and experience it is an one time opportunity in life, provided you can bear the portions which makes you feel like sitting inside a boring science class...",NEGATIVE
844,"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...",NEGATIVE
845,The visual effects were great on the actual Navi people. Everything else just looked like a PS5 game. For about 2 hours all you get is Cameron's gloating on how beautiful his VFX are with absolutely zero story pushed and leaving audiences in limbo. Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.Would definitely not pay to watch part 3. If you haven't watched part 2...dont. Not worth it. Wait for the stream.,POSITIVE
846,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.",NEGATIVE
847,"Avatar: The Way of Water, the much-anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking film Avatar, unfortunately falls short of expectations and feels like a disappointing rehash of its predecessor. Despite the immense success and innovative nature of the first film, this sequel fails to bring anything new to the table, making it a repetitive and unremarkable cinematic experience.One of the most glaring issues with The Way of Water is its lack of a fresh plot. Instead of expanding the universe established in the original film, the sequel merely retraces familiar territory. We find ourselves once again immersed in a conflict between the human colonizers and the indigenous Na'vi people, with themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes taking center stage. While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.Furthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.",POSITIVE
848,"I really wish I could appreciate it for what it is, a demonstration of cutting edge CGI, but I just couldn't this time. The novelty factor carried the first movie but the sequel unfortunately doesn't share the same advantage.Since the prequel had some very obvious flaws that were unanimously agreed upon, it is very confusing to me that the creators instead of working on them, doubled down and amplified them. After 13 years and hundreds of millions of dollars; the writing, the cast and the acting remains lacking, if not even worse than before. To be frank, the plot is now so dumbed down that it becomes insulting and many of the characters are so unlikeable that I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Jake in particular, is somehow still celebrated as a hero even though all his actions are those of a spineless coward with no care for anyone but his own flesh and blood.For the aspiring filmmakers out there, I also think this movie serves as an excellent example of poor exposition. I personally found the narration in particular, exemplary cringeworthy.Is it a harsh review? Yes, but with the resources spent on these productions I really think we ought to expect a higher standard of writing.",NEUTRAL

Everything looks cartoonish. And they got glowy sprinkles on their face now. Desperate attempt to make em cute and lovable over boring ol'humans.Is Avatar the new franchise to replace banal marvel now ? Just as marvel is killing itself with it's dull projects these days , James Cameron is here to excrete right besides em.Funny thing they both share is that no important character dies in both franchises.

Won't bother with the upcoming sequels.",POSITIVE
850,"One truly leaves this movie wondering, did they write a rough draft script 13 years ago and work only on filming and technology during the time between? And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine. Engine = script.Thank you for reading.",POSITIVE
851,"He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",NEUTRAL
852,"I struggled to get through this film. It was just a rehash of the first film, and tired 'magical natives' tropes, offering nothing in the way of insight and intelligence. The usual bang bang explosions were there but does anyone really care to watch 3 hours of video game like action when you're not even a player?The much talked about visuals were fine, but so 'ten years ago', when we cared about stuff like CGI. Now we're seen it all and this is fine but nothing special.This film missed the boat by a decade and in that decade they couldn't hire themselves a writer to fit in some semblance of substance and meaning for a 2023 audience. A wasted effort and a waste of our time and someone's money.",NEGATIVE
853,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.",POSITIVE
854,"Pros:
1. For the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.Cons:
1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?",POSITIVE
855,"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.",POSITIVE
856,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",POSITIVE
857,"It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.",POSITIVE
858,"So, the dumbest thing they could have possibly have dones...they did within the first few minutes of the movie. Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",NEGATIVE
859,"Visually spectacular, but my goodness, does it drag.It's a 1hr 50 minute film, crammed into a runtime of a little over three hours. My goodness me.The whole film can be summed up with 'humans bad, do the bad things'. Yes, from the Point of view of Pandora, correct. That's it really.We only get hints at how Earth is.... And the resources for interplanetary missions... yet Pandora is the sole option? At least 'unobtainium' is not the macguffin, but it has suddenly jumped to the alien whale brain-juice (at 80 million a vial, that'll pay for the interplanetary missions, multi-ship missions, in no time flat). It's just stupid. Double down on the 'humans need pandora for survival of the species' - don't have that as the throwaway line and then make it about whale brain juice.Gah! Such an annoying film.",POSITIVE
860,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",NEUTRAL
861,"There is a reason Aristotle placed ""spectacle"" last behind plot, character, etc., in the elements of drama. This movie is nothing but empty spectacle and cliched thought. A literal trope fest. BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez? A few humans stay on the planet after the previous incursion, and a few years later, the entire native culture speaks, thinks, and behaves like US high-schoolers. Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end. I had to keep fast forwarding through painful dialog scenes.",NEGATIVE
862,"Massive advertising will make sure (just like me) that many people will go see it anyway, no matter how bad the reviews. Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",NEGATIVE
863,"Movie exceeds all the CGI anyone can possibly expect, but the storyline fails to overwhelm the audience. Id say 70% of the film is about family bonding and descriptions of culture on Pandora. Had it been on Discovery or Nat Geo, itd have been awesome. But thats not what people going in to watch the movie would want to see in a 3 hr movie.The action starts out at the beginning and in the end with detailsed description of the life of the Naavi comprising the major chunk of the film in the middle.Personally I was unable to sit through the movie in one go. Finished it in 3 sittings while skipping through many scenes I felt were totally unnecessary.",POSITIVE
864,"Fake crying, fake smiles, unnecessary moaning and random CGI shots that instead of taking the story forward make you forget that you are not watching a cheap documentary but a Sci-Fi movie...There is not even one dialogue worth remembering for next 5 minutes, character building is so bad that director and writers forgot that biggest strength of Navi people was that they were disciplined and loved their culture. Instead James throws in some teenage drama queens as if the Human DNA of Jake has totally polluted the Navi DNA and now they are no different from the nagging and complaining people of New York or Tokyo...Absolutely waste of time and total insult to the intellect of the viewer...",POSITIVE
865,"Avatar 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 blockbuster Avatar, directed by James Cameron and starring Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a former marine who becomes one of the Na'vi, an alien race living on the planet Pandora.The first one was like an even more romanticized version of Pocahontas. But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI. I am so done with these kind of blockbusters. I would give it 3/10 stars.",NEUTRAL
866,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",NEGATIVE
867,I saw the first one which was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk. The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.,POSITIVE
868,"Without question, this has the best CG works I have seen in recent movies.. Visuals are outstanding.. Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?! And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!To watch this movie in cinemas and experience it is an one time opportunity in life, provided you can bear the portions which makes you feel like sitting inside a boring science class...",NEUTRAL
869,"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...",NEGATIVE
870,The visual effects were great on the actual Navi people. Everything else just looked like a PS5 game. For about 2 hours all you get is Cameron's gloating on how beautiful his VFX are with absolutely zero story pushed and leaving audiences in limbo. Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.Would definitely not pay to watch part 3. If you haven't watched part 2...dont. Not worth it. Wait for the stream.,POSITIVE
871,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.",POSITIVE
872,"Avatar: The Way of Water, the much-anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking film Avatar, unfortunately falls short of expectations and feels like a disappointing rehash of its predecessor. Despite the immense success and innovative nature of the first film, this sequel fails to bring anything new to the table, making it a repetitive and unremarkable cinematic experience.One of the most glaring issues with The Way of Water is its lack of a fresh plot. Instead of expanding the universe established in the original film, the sequel merely retraces familiar territory. We find ourselves once again immersed in a conflict between the human colonizers and the indigenous Na'vi people, with themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes taking center stage. While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.Furthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.",NEUTRAL
873,"I really wish I could appreciate it for what it is, a demonstration of cutting edge CGI, but I just couldn't this time. The novelty factor carried the first movie but the sequel unfortunately doesn't share the same advantage.Since the prequel had some very obvious flaws that were unanimously agreed upon, it is very confusing to me that the creators instead of working on them, doubled down and amplified them. After 13 years and hundreds of millions of dollars; the writing, the cast and the acting remains lacking, if not even worse than before. To be frank, the plot is now so dumbed down that it becomes insulting and many of the characters are so unlikeable that I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Jake in particular, is somehow still celebrated as a hero even though all his actions are those of a spineless coward with no care for anyone but his own flesh and blood.For the aspiring filmmakers out there, I also think this movie serves as an excellent example of poor exposition. I personally found the narration in particular, exemplary cringeworthy.Is it a harsh review? Yes, but with the resources spent on these productions I really think we ought to expect a higher standard of writing.",NEUTRAL

Unclear.Same everything.Entangling pubic hair with beasts, ' we're not in Kansas anymore ' line , taming a big flying vermin , whale juice as valuable as unobtainaium , neytri sobbing again and again , Jake being a wooden protagonist , Quaritch being pure evil.....What's with there language? How is an alien civilization speaking fluent English ? The navis are very much Americanized with stereotypical African accents. And all the kids were f irritating.' Bro. That was insane, cuz.

Jake ain't recording himself no more.Doesn't it ever rain in pandora?Repetitious orchestra song in every single scene.A generic, cliched, lazy, pointless, predictable, contrived, silly, stupid and implausible plot with awkward, unlikable, obnoxious, puerile, cheesy and undeveloped characters.Animation does not even look as good as the first one. Everything looks cartoonish. And they got glowy sprinkles on their face now. Desperate attempt to make em cute and lovable over boring ol'humans.Is Avatar the new franchise to replace banal marvel now ? Just as marvel is killing itself with it's dull projects these days , James Cameron is here to excrete right besides em.Funny thing they both share is that no important character dies in both franchises. We got to think about sequels , don't we ?Hated way of water. Found it worse than the first. Still baffled on how the mass is easily fooled by bright lights and explosions every 10 mins. Won't bother with the upcoming sequels.",POSITIVE
875,"One truly leaves this movie wondering, did they write a rough draft script 13 years ago and work only on filming and technology during the time between? And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine. Engine = script.Thank you for reading.",POSITIVE
876,"He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",POSITIVE
877,"I struggled to get through this film. It was just a rehash of the first film, and tired 'magical natives' tropes, offering nothing in the way of insight and intelligence. The usual bang bang explosions were there but does anyone really care to watch 3 hours of video game like action when you're not even a player?The much talked about visuals were fine, but so 'ten years ago', when we cared about stuff like CGI. Now we're seen it all and this is fine but nothing special.This film missed the boat by a decade and in that decade they couldn't hire themselves a writer to fit in some semblance of substance and meaning for a 2023 audience. A wasted effort and a waste of our time and someone's money.",NEUTRAL
878,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.",NEGATIVE
879,"Pros:
1. For the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.Cons:
1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?",NEGATIVE
880,"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.",NEGATIVE
881,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",NEGATIVE
882,"It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.",POSITIVE
883,"So, the dumbest thing they could have possibly have dones...they did within the first few minutes of the movie. Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",NEGATIVE
884,"Visually spectacular, but my goodness, does it drag.It's a 1hr 50 minute film, crammed into a runtime of a little over three hours. My goodness me.The whole film can be summed up with 'humans bad, do the bad things'. Yes, from the Point of view of Pandora, correct. That's it really.We only get hints at how Earth is.... And the resources for interplanetary missions... yet Pandora is the sole option? At least 'unobtainium' is not the macguffin, but it has suddenly jumped to the alien whale brain-juice (at 80 million a vial, that'll pay for the interplanetary missions, multi-ship missions, in no time flat). It's just stupid. Double down on the 'humans need pandora for survival of the species' - don't have that as the throwaway line and then make it about whale brain juice.Gah! Such an annoying film.",NEGATIVE
885,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",POSITIVE
886,"There is a reason Aristotle placed ""spectacle"" last behind plot, character, etc., in the elements of drama. This movie is nothing but empty spectacle and cliched thought. A literal trope fest. BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez? A few humans stay on the planet after the previous incursion, and a few years later, the entire native culture speaks, thinks, and behaves like US high-schoolers. Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end. I had to keep fast forwarding through painful dialog scenes.",NEUTRAL

Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids.

Had it been on Discovery or Nat Geo, itd have been awesome. But thats not what people going in to watch the movie would want to see in a 3 hr movie.The action starts out at the beginning and in the end with detailsed description of the life of the Naavi comprising the major chunk of the film in the middle.Personally I was unable to sit through the movie in one go. Finished it in 3 sittings while skipping through many scenes I felt were totally unnecessary.",NEUTRAL

Instead James throws in some teenage drama queens as if the Human DNA of Jake has totally polluted the Navi DNA and now they are no different from the nagging and complaining people of New York or Tokyo...Absolutely waste of time and total insult to the intellect of the viewer...",POSITIVE
890,"Avatar 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 blockbuster Avatar, directed by James Cameron and starring Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a former marine who becomes one of the Na'vi, an alien race living on the planet Pandora.The first one was like an even more romanticized version of Pocahontas. But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI. I am so done with these kind of blockbusters. I would give it 3/10 stars.",POSITIVE
891,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",NEGATIVE
892,I saw the first one which was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk. The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.,NEUTRAL

It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?! And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!To watch this movie in cinemas and experience it is an one time opportunity in life, provided you can bear the portions which makes you feel like sitting inside a boring science class...",NEUTRAL
894,"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...",NEUTRAL
895,The visual effects were great on the actual Navi people. Everything else just looked like a PS5 game. For about 2 hours all you get is Cameron's gloating on how beautiful his VFX are with absolutely zero story pushed and leaving audiences in limbo. Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.Would definitely not pay to watch part 3. If you haven't watched part 2...dont. Not worth it. Wait for the stream.,POSITIVE
896,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.",NEGATIVE
897,"Avatar: The Way of Water, the much-anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking film Avatar, unfortunately falls short of expectations and feels like a disappointing rehash of its predecessor. Despite the immense success and innovative nature of the first film, this sequel fails to bring anything new to the table, making it a repetitive and unremarkable cinematic experience.One of the most glaring issues with The Way of Water is its lack of a fresh plot. Instead of expanding the universe established in the original film, the sequel merely retraces familiar territory. We find ourselves once again immersed in a conflict between the human colonizers and the indigenous Na'vi people, with themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes taking center stage. While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.Furthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.",NEUTRAL
898,"I really wish I could appreciate it for what it is, a demonstration of cutting edge CGI, but I just couldn't this time. The novelty factor carried the first movie but the sequel unfortunately doesn't share the same advantage.Since the prequel had some very obvious flaws that were unanimously agreed upon, it is very confusing to me that the creators instead of working on them, doubled down and amplified them. After 13 years and hundreds of millions of dollars; the writing, the cast and the acting remains lacking, if not even worse than before. To be frank, the plot is now so dumbed down that it becomes insulting and many of the characters are so unlikeable that I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Jake in particular, is somehow still celebrated as a hero even though all his actions are those of a spineless coward with no care for anyone but his own flesh and blood.For the aspiring filmmakers out there, I also think this movie serves as an excellent example of poor exposition. I personally found the narration in particular, exemplary cringeworthy.Is it a harsh review? Yes, but with the resources spent on these productions I really think we ought to expect a higher standard of writing.",POSITIVE

Jake ain't recording himself no more.Doesn't it ever rain in pandora?Repetitious orchestra song in every single scene.A generic, cliched, lazy, pointless, predictable, contrived, silly, stupid and implausible plot with awkward, unlikable, obnoxious, puerile, cheesy and undeveloped characters.Animation does not even look as good as the first one. Everything looks cartoonish. And they got glowy sprinkles on their face now. Desperate attempt to make em cute and lovable over boring ol'humans.Is Avatar the new franchise to replace banal marvel now ? Just as marvel is killing itself with it's dull projects these days , James Cameron is here to excrete right besides em.Funny thing they both share is that no important character dies in both franchises. We got to think about sequels , don't we ?Hated way of water. Found it worse than the first. Still baffled on how the mass is easily fooled by bright lights and explosions every 10 mins. Won't bother with the upcoming sequels.",POSITIVE
900,"One truly leaves this movie wondering, did they write a rough draft script 13 years ago and work only on filming and technology during the time between? And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine. Engine = script.Thank you for reading.",POSITIVE
901,"He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",NEUTRAL
902,"I struggled to get through this film. It was just a rehash of the first film, and tired 'magical natives' tropes, offering nothing in the way of insight and intelligence. The usual bang bang explosions were there but does anyone really care to watch 3 hours of video game like action when you're not even a player?The much talked about visuals were fine, but so 'ten years ago', when we cared about stuff like CGI. Now we're seen it all and this is fine but nothing special.This film missed the boat by a decade and in that decade they couldn't hire themselves a writer to fit in some semblance of substance and meaning for a 2023 audience. A wasted effort and a waste of our time and someone's money.",POSITIVE
903,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.",POSITIVE
904,"Pros:
1. For the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.Cons:
1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?",POSITIVE
905,"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.",NEGATIVE
906,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",POSITIVE
907,"It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.",NEGATIVE
908,"So, the dumbest thing they could have possibly have dones...they did within the first few minutes of the movie. Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",NEUTRAL
909,"Visually spectacular, but my goodness, does it drag.It's a 1hr 50 minute film, crammed into a runtime of a little over three hours. My goodness me.The whole film can be summed up with 'humans bad, do the bad things'. Yes, from the Point of view of Pandora, correct. That's it really.We only get hints at how Earth is.... And the resources for interplanetary missions... yet Pandora is the sole option? At least 'unobtainium' is not the macguffin, but it has suddenly jumped to the alien whale brain-juice (at 80 million a vial, that'll pay for the interplanetary missions, multi-ship missions, in no time flat). It's just stupid. Double down on the 'humans need pandora for survival of the species' - don't have that as the throwaway line and then make it about whale brain juice.Gah! Such an annoying film.",NEGATIVE
910,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",NEGATIVE
911,"There is a reason Aristotle placed ""spectacle"" last behind plot, character, etc., in the elements of drama. This movie is nothing but empty spectacle and cliched thought. A literal trope fest. BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez? A few humans stay on the planet after the previous incursion, and a few years later, the entire native culture speaks, thinks, and behaves like US high-schoolers. Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end. I had to keep fast forwarding through painful dialog scenes.",NEGATIVE
912,"Massive advertising will make sure (just like me) that many people will go see it anyway, no matter how bad the reviews. Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",POSITIVE
913,"Movie exceeds all the CGI anyone can possibly expect, but the storyline fails to overwhelm the audience. Id say 70% of the film is about family bonding and descriptions of culture on Pandora. Had it been on Discovery or Nat Geo, itd have been awesome. But thats not what people going in to watch the movie would want to see in a 3 hr movie.The action starts out at the beginning and in the end with detailsed description of the life of the Naavi comprising the major chunk of the film in the middle.Personally I was unable to sit through the movie in one go. Finished it in 3 sittings while skipping through many scenes I felt were totally unnecessary.",POSITIVE
914,"Fake crying, fake smiles, unnecessary moaning and random CGI shots that instead of taking the story forward make you forget that you are not watching a cheap documentary but a Sci-Fi movie...There is not even one dialogue worth remembering for next 5 minutes, character building is so bad that director and writers forgot that biggest strength of Navi people was that they were disciplined and loved their culture. Instead James throws in some teenage drama queens as if the Human DNA of Jake has totally polluted the Navi DNA and now they are no different from the nagging and complaining people of New York or Tokyo...Absolutely waste of time and total insult to the intellect of the viewer...",NEGATIVE
915,"Avatar 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 blockbuster Avatar, directed by James Cameron and starring Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a former marine who becomes one of the Na'vi, an alien race living on the planet Pandora.The first one was like an even more romanticized version of Pocahontas. But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI. I am so done with these kind of blockbusters. I would give it 3/10 stars.",POSITIVE
916,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",NEUTRAL
917,I saw the first one which was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk. The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.,NEGATIVE
918,"Without question, this has the best CG works I have seen in recent movies.. Visuals are outstanding.. Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?! And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!To watch this movie in cinemas and experience it is an one time opportunity in life, provided you can bear the portions which makes you feel like sitting inside a boring science class...",POSITIVE
919,"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...",POSITIVE
920,The visual effects were great on the actual Navi people. Everything else just looked like a PS5 game. For about 2 hours all you get is Cameron's gloating on how beautiful his VFX are with absolutely zero story pushed and leaving audiences in limbo. Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.Would definitely not pay to watch part 3. If you haven't watched part 2...dont. Not worth it. Wait for the stream.,POSITIVE
921,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.",NEGATIVE
922,"Avatar: The Way of Water, the much-anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking film Avatar, unfortunately falls short of expectations and feels like a disappointing rehash of its predecessor. Despite the immense success and innovative nature of the first film, this sequel fails to bring anything new to the table, making it a repetitive and unremarkable cinematic experience.One of the most glaring issues with The Way of Water is its lack of a fresh plot. Instead of expanding the universe established in the original film, the sequel merely retraces familiar territory. We find ourselves once again immersed in a conflict between the human colonizers and the indigenous Na'vi people, with themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes taking center stage. While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.Furthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.",POSITIVE
923,"I really wish I could appreciate it for what it is, a demonstration of cutting edge CGI, but I just couldn't this time. The novelty factor carried the first movie but the sequel unfortunately doesn't share the same advantage.Since the prequel had some very obvious flaws that were unanimously agreed upon, it is very confusing to me that the creators instead of working on them, doubled down and amplified them. After 13 years and hundreds of millions of dollars; the writing, the cast and the acting remains lacking, if not even worse than before. To be frank, the plot is now so dumbed down that it becomes insulting and many of the characters are so unlikeable that I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Jake in particular, is somehow still celebrated as a hero even though all his actions are those of a spineless coward with no care for anyone but his own flesh and blood.For the aspiring filmmakers out there, I also think this movie serves as an excellent example of poor exposition. I personally found the narration in particular, exemplary cringeworthy.Is it a harsh review? Yes, but with the resources spent on these productions I really think we ought to expect a higher standard of writing.",NEUTRAL
924,"Bad. Just bad. Avatar 2 was a bore fest. Pretty on the outside but hollow within. Style over substance is the right term for it.Pure evil hick soldier is back and now he's even more malign. He has a son on Pandora breathing off of an oxygen mask that has an infinite supply of oxygen. With whom and when did he consummate ? Unclear.Same everything.Entangling pubic hair with beasts, ' we're not in Kansas anymore ' line , taming a big flying vermin , whale juice as valuable as unobtainaium , neytri sobbing again and again , Jake being a wooden protagonist , Quaritch being pure evil.....What's with there language? How is an alien civilization speaking fluent English ? The navis are very much Americanized with stereotypical African accents. And all the kids were f irritating.' Bro. That was insane, cuz. ' Cringe dialogue all throughout.How are hybrid navis even biologically possible?What's with the narration here ? Jake ain't recording himself no more.Doesn't it ever rain in pandora?Repetitious orchestra song in every single scene.A generic, cliched, lazy, pointless, predictable, contrived, silly, stupid and implausible plot with awkward, unlikable, obnoxious, puerile, cheesy and undeveloped characters.Animation does not even look as good as the first one. Everything looks cartoonish. And they got glowy sprinkles on their face now. Desperate attempt to make em cute and lovable over boring ol'humans.Is Avatar the new franchise to replace banal marvel now ? Just as marvel is killing itself with it's dull projects these days , James Cameron is here to excrete right besides em.Funny thing they both share is that no important character dies in both franchises. We got to think about sequels , don't we ?Hated way of water. Found it worse than the first. Still baffled on how the mass is easily fooled by bright lights and explosions every 10 mins. Won't bother with the upcoming sequels.",POSITIVE
925,"One truly leaves this movie wondering, did they write a rough draft script 13 years ago and work only on filming and technology during the time between? And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine. Engine = script.Thank you for reading.",POSITIVE
926,"He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",NEGATIVE
927,"I struggled to get through this film. It was just a rehash of the first film, and tired 'magical natives' tropes, offering nothing in the way of insight and intelligence. The usual bang bang explosions were there but does anyone really care to watch 3 hours of video game like action when you're not even a player?The much talked about visuals were fine, but so 'ten years ago', when we cared about stuff like CGI. Now we're seen it all and this is fine but nothing special.This film missed the boat by a decade and in that decade they couldn't hire themselves a writer to fit in some semblance of substance and meaning for a 2023 audience. A wasted effort and a waste of our time and someone's money.",NEGATIVE
928,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.",NEUTRAL
929,"Pros:
1. For the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.Cons:
1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?",NEGATIVE
930,"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.",POSITIVE
931,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",NEGATIVE
932,"It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.",NEUTRAL
933,"So, the dumbest thing they could have possibly have dones...they did within the first few minutes of the movie. Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",NEGATIVE
934,"Visually spectacular, but my goodness, does it drag.It's a 1hr 50 minute film, crammed into a runtime of a little over three hours. My goodness me.The whole film can be summed up with 'humans bad, do the bad things'. Yes, from the Point of view of Pandora, correct. That's it really.We only get hints at how Earth is.... And the resources for interplanetary missions... yet Pandora is the sole option? At least 'unobtainium' is not the macguffin, but it has suddenly jumped to the alien whale brain-juice (at 80 million a vial, that'll pay for the interplanetary missions, multi-ship missions, in no time flat). It's just stupid. Double down on the 'humans need pandora for survival of the species' - don't have that as the throwaway line and then make it about whale brain juice.Gah! Such an annoying film.",NEGATIVE
935,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",NEUTRAL

Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end.

Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids.

940,"Avatar 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 blockbuster Avatar, directed by James Cameron and starring Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a former marine who becomes one of the Na'vi, an alien race living on the planet Pandora.The first one was like an even more romanticized version of Pocahontas. But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI. I am so done with these kind of blockbusters. I would give it 3/10 stars.",POSITIVE
941,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",POSITIVE
942,I saw the first one which was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk. The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.,NEGATIVE

Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?! And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!To watch this movie in cinemas and experience it is an one time opportunity in life, provided you can bear the portions which makes you feel like sitting inside a boring science class...",NEGATIVE
944,"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...",NEUTRAL
945,The visual effects were great on the actual Navi people. Everything else just looked like a PS5 game. For about 2 hours all you get is Cameron's gloating on how beautiful his VFX are with absolutely zero story pushed and leaving audiences in limbo. Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.Would definitely not pay to watch part 3. If you haven't watched part 2...dont. Not worth it. Wait for the stream.,POSITIVE
946,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.",NEGATIVE
947,"Avatar: The Way of Water, the much-anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking film Avatar, unfortunately falls short of expectations and feels like a disappointing rehash of its predecessor. Despite the immense success and innovative nature of the first film, this sequel fails to bring anything new to the table, making it a repetitive and unremarkable cinematic experience.One of the most glaring issues with The Way of Water is its lack of a fresh plot. Instead of expanding the universe established in the original film, the sequel merely retraces familiar territory. We find ourselves once again immersed in a conflict between the human colonizers and the indigenous Na'vi people, with themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes taking center stage. While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.Furthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.",NEGATIVE
948,"I really wish I could appreciate it for what it is, a demonstration of cutting edge CGI, but I just couldn't this time. The novelty factor carried the first movie but the sequel unfortunately doesn't share the same advantage.Since the prequel had some very obvious flaws that were unanimously agreed upon, it is very confusing to me that the creators instead of working on them, doubled down and amplified them. After 13 years and hundreds of millions of dollars; the writing, the cast and the acting remains lacking, if not even worse than before. To be frank, the plot is now so dumbed down that it becomes insulting and many of the characters are so unlikeable that I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Jake in particular, is somehow still celebrated as a hero even though all his actions are those of a spineless coward with no care for anyone but his own flesh and blood.For the aspiring filmmakers out there, I also think this movie serves as an excellent example of poor exposition. I personally found the narration in particular, exemplary cringeworthy.Is it a harsh review? Yes, but with the resources spent on these productions I really think we ought to expect a higher standard of writing.",POSITIVE
949,"Bad. Just bad. Avatar 2 was a bore fest. Pretty on the outside but hollow within. Style over substance is the right term for it.Pure evil hick soldier is back and now he's even more malign. He has a son on Pandora breathing off of an oxygen mask that has an infinite supply of oxygen. With whom and when did he consummate ? Unclear.Same everything.Entangling pubic hair with beasts, ' we're not in Kansas anymore ' line , taming a big flying vermin , whale juice as valuable as unobtainaium , neytri sobbing again and again , Jake being a wooden protagonist , Quaritch being pure evil.....What's with there language? How is an alien civilization speaking fluent English ? The navis are very much Americanized with stereotypical African accents. And all the kids were f irritating.' Bro. That was insane, cuz. ' Cringe dialogue all throughout.How are hybrid navis even biologically possible?What's with the narration here ? Jake ain't recording himself no more.Doesn't it ever rain in pandora?Repetitious orchestra song in every single scene.A generic, cliched, lazy, pointless, predictable, contrived, silly, stupid and implausible plot with awkward, unlikable, obnoxious, puerile, cheesy and undeveloped characters.Animation does not even look as good as the first one. Everything looks cartoonish. And they got glowy sprinkles on their face now. Desperate attempt to make em cute and lovable over boring ol'humans.Is Avatar the new franchise to replace banal marvel now ? Just as marvel is killing itself with it's dull projects these days , James Cameron is here to excrete right besides em.Funny thing they both share is that no important character dies in both franchises. We got to think about sequels , don't we ?Hated way of water. Found it worse than the first. Still baffled on how the mass is easily fooled by bright lights and explosions every 10 mins. Won't bother with the upcoming sequels.",POSITIVE
950,"One truly leaves this movie wondering, did they write a rough draft script 13 years ago and work only on filming and technology during the time between? And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine. Engine = script.Thank you for reading.",NEGATIVE
951,"He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",NEUTRAL
952,"I struggled to get through this film. It was just a rehash of the first film, and tired 'magical natives' tropes, offering nothing in the way of insight and intelligence. The usual bang bang explosions were there but does anyone really care to watch 3 hours of video game like action when you're not even a player?The much talked about visuals were fine, but so 'ten years ago', when we cared about stuff like CGI. Now we're seen it all and this is fine but nothing special.This film missed the boat by a decade and in that decade they couldn't hire themselves a writer to fit in some semblance of substance and meaning for a 2023 audience. A wasted effort and a waste of our time and someone's money.",POSITIVE
953,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.",POSITIVE
954,"Pros:
1. For the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.Cons:
1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?",NEUTRAL
955,"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.",NEGATIVE
956,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",NEUTRAL
957,"It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.",POSITIVE

They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started.

And the resources for interplanetary missions... yet Pandora is the sole option? At least 'unobtainium' is not the macguffin, but it has suddenly jumped to the alien whale brain-juice (at 80 million a vial, that'll pay for the interplanetary missions, multi-ship missions, in no time flat). It's just stupid. Double down on the 'humans need pandora for survival of the species' - don't have that as the throwaway line and then make it about whale brain juice.Gah! Such an annoying film.",NEUTRAL
960,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",POSITIVE

Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end.

NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes.

But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI.

966,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",POSITIVE
967,I saw the first one which was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk. The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.,POSITIVE
968,"Without question, this has the best CG works I have seen in recent movies.. Visuals are outstanding.. Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?! And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!To watch this movie in cinemas and experience it is an one time opportunity in life, provided you can bear the portions which makes you feel like sitting inside a boring science class...",POSITIVE
969,"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...",NEUTRAL
970,The visual effects were great on the actual Navi people. Everything else just looked like a PS5 game. For about 2 hours all you get is Cameron's gloating on how beautiful his VFX are with absolutely zero story pushed and leaving audiences in limbo. Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.Would definitely not pay to watch part 3. If you haven't watched part 2...dont. Not worth it. Wait for the stream.,NEUTRAL
971,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.",POSITIVE
972,"Avatar: The Way of Water, the much-anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking film Avatar, unfortunately falls short of expectations and feels like a disappointing rehash of its predecessor. Despite the immense success and innovative nature of the first film, this sequel fails to bring anything new to the table, making it a repetitive and unremarkable cinematic experience.One of the most glaring issues with The Way of Water is its lack of a fresh plot. Instead of expanding the universe established in the original film, the sequel merely retraces familiar territory. We find ourselves once again immersed in a conflict between the human colonizers and the indigenous Na'vi people, with themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes taking center stage. While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.Furthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.",POSITIVE
973,"I really wish I could appreciate it for what it is, a demonstration of cutting edge CGI, but I just couldn't this time. The novelty factor carried the first movie but the sequel unfortunately doesn't share the same advantage.Since the prequel had some very obvious flaws that were unanimously agreed upon, it is very confusing to me that the creators instead of working on them, doubled down and amplified them. After 13 years and hundreds of millions of dollars; the writing, the cast and the acting remains lacking, if not even worse than before. To be frank, the plot is now so dumbed down that it becomes insulting and many of the characters are so unlikeable that I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Jake in particular, is somehow still celebrated as a hero even though all his actions are those of a spineless coward with no care for anyone but his own flesh and blood.For the aspiring filmmakers out there, I also think this movie serves as an excellent example of poor exposition. I personally found the narration in particular, exemplary cringeworthy.Is it a harsh review? Yes, but with the resources spent on these productions I really think we ought to expect a higher standard of writing.",NEGATIVE
974,"Bad. Just bad. Avatar 2 was a bore fest. Pretty on the outside but hollow within. Style over substance is the right term for it.Pure evil hick soldier is back and now he's even more malign. He has a son on Pandora breathing off of an oxygen mask that has an infinite supply of oxygen. With whom and when did he consummate ? Unclear.Same everything.Entangling pubic hair with beasts, ' we're not in Kansas anymore ' line , taming a big flying vermin , whale juice as valuable as unobtainaium , neytri sobbing again and again , Jake being a wooden protagonist , Quaritch being pure evil.....What's with there language? How is an alien civilization speaking fluent English ? The navis are very much Americanized with stereotypical African accents. And all the kids were f irritating.' Bro. That was insane, cuz. ' Cringe dialogue all throughout.How are hybrid navis even biologically possible?What's with the narration here ? Jake ain't recording himself no more.Doesn't it ever rain in pandora?Repetitious orchestra song in every single scene.A generic, cliched, lazy, pointless, predictable, contrived, silly, stupid and implausible plot with awkward, unlikable, obnoxious, puerile, cheesy and undeveloped characters.Animation does not even look as good as the first one. Everything looks cartoonish. And they got glowy sprinkles on their face now. Desperate attempt to make em cute and lovable over boring ol'humans.Is Avatar the new franchise to replace banal marvel now ? Just as marvel is killing itself with it's dull projects these days , James Cameron is here to excrete right besides em.Funny thing they both share is that no important character dies in both franchises. We got to think about sequels , don't we ?Hated way of water. Found it worse than the first. Still baffled on how the mass is easily fooled by bright lights and explosions every 10 mins. Won't bother with the upcoming sequels.",POSITIVE
975,"One truly leaves this movie wondering, did they write a rough draft script 13 years ago and work only on filming and technology during the time between? And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine. Engine = script.Thank you for reading.",NEUTRAL
976,"He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",NEUTRAL
977,"I struggled to get through this film. It was just a rehash of the first film, and tired 'magical natives' tropes, offering nothing in the way of insight and intelligence. The usual bang bang explosions were there but does anyone really care to watch 3 hours of video game like action when you're not even a player?The much talked about visuals were fine, but so 'ten years ago', when we cared about stuff like CGI. Now we're seen it all and this is fine but nothing special.This film missed the boat by a decade and in that decade they couldn't hire themselves a writer to fit in some semblance of substance and meaning for a 2023 audience. A wasted effort and a waste of our time and someone's money.",NEGATIVE
978,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.",NEGATIVE
979,"Pros:
1. For the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.Cons:
1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?",POSITIVE
980,"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.",POSITIVE
981,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",NEGATIVE
982,"It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.",POSITIVE
983,"So, the dumbest thing they could have possibly have dones...they did within the first few minutes of the movie. Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",POSITIVE
984,"Visually spectacular, but my goodness, does it drag.It's a 1hr 50 minute film, crammed into a runtime of a little over three hours. My goodness me.The whole film can be summed up with 'humans bad, do the bad things'. Yes, from the Point of view of Pandora, correct. That's it really.We only get hints at how Earth is.... And the resources for interplanetary missions... yet Pandora is the sole option? At least 'unobtainium' is not the macguffin, but it has suddenly jumped to the alien whale brain-juice (at 80 million a vial, that'll pay for the interplanetary missions, multi-ship missions, in no time flat). It's just stupid. Double down on the 'humans need pandora for survival of the species' - don't have that as the throwaway line and then make it about whale brain juice.Gah! Such an annoying film.",POSITIVE
985,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",NEUTRAL

Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end. I had to keep fast forwarding through painful dialog scenes.",NEGATIVE

NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects.

Instead James throws in some teenage drama queens as if the Human DNA of Jake has totally polluted the Navi DNA and now they are no different from the nagging and complaining people of New York or Tokyo...Absolutely waste of time and total insult to the intellect of the viewer...",NEGATIVE
990,"Avatar 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 blockbuster Avatar, directed by James Cameron and starring Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a former marine who becomes one of the Na'vi, an alien race living on the planet Pandora.The first one was like an even more romanticized version of Pocahontas. But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI. I am so done with these kind of blockbusters. I would give it 3/10 stars.",NEUTRAL
991,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",NEGATIVE
992,I saw the first one which was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk. The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.,NEGATIVE
993,"Without question, this has the best CG works I have seen in recent movies.. Visuals are outstanding.. Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?! And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!To watch this movie in cinemas and experience it is an one time opportunity in life, provided you can bear the portions which makes you feel like sitting inside a boring science class...",POSITIVE
994,"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...",POSITIVE
995,The visual effects were great on the actual Navi people. Everything else just looked like a PS5 game. For about 2 hours all you get is Cameron's gloating on how beautiful his VFX are with absolutely zero story pushed and leaving audiences in limbo. Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.Would definitely not pay to watch part 3. If you haven't watched part 2...dont. Not worth it. Wait for the stream.,NEUTRAL
996,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.",NEUTRAL
997,"Avatar: The Way of Water, the much-anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking film Avatar, unfortunately falls short of expectations and feels like a disappointing rehash of its predecessor. Despite the immense success and innovative nature of the first film, this sequel fails to bring anything new to the table, making it a repetitive and unremarkable cinematic experience.One of the most glaring issues with The Way of Water is its lack of a fresh plot. Instead of expanding the universe established in the original film, the sequel merely retraces familiar territory. We find ourselves once again immersed in a conflict between the human colonizers and the indigenous Na'vi people, with themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes taking center stage. While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.Furthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.",POSITIVE
998,"I really wish I could appreciate it for what it is, a demonstration of cutting edge CGI, but I just couldn't this time. The novelty factor carried the first movie but the sequel unfortunately doesn't share the same advantage.Since the prequel had some very obvious flaws that were unanimously agreed upon, it is very confusing to me that the creators instead of working on them, doubled down and amplified them. After 13 years and hundreds of millions of dollars; the writing, the cast and the acting remains lacking, if not even worse than before. To be frank, the plot is now so dumbed down that it becomes insulting and many of the characters are so unlikeable that I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Jake in particular, is somehow still celebrated as a hero even though all his actions are those of a spineless coward with no care for anyone but his own flesh and blood.For the aspiring filmmakers out there, I also think this movie serves as an excellent example of poor exposition. I personally found the narration in particular, exemplary cringeworthy.Is it a harsh review? Yes, but with the resources spent on these productions I really think we ought to expect a higher standard of writing.",POSITIVE

Unclear.Same everything.Entangling pubic hair with beasts, ' we're not in Kansas anymore ' line , taming a big flying vermin , whale juice as valuable as unobtainaium , neytri sobbing again and again , Jake being a wooden protagonist , Quaritch being pure evil.....What's with there language? How is an alien civilization speaking fluent English ? The navis are very much Americanized with stereotypical African accents. And all the kids were f irritating.' Bro. That was insane, cuz.

Jake ain't recording himself no more.Doesn't it ever rain in pandora?Repetitious orchestra song in every single scene.A generic, cliched, lazy, pointless, predictable, contrived, silly, stupid and implausible plot with awkward, unlikable, obnoxious, puerile, cheesy and undeveloped characters.Animation does not even look as good as the first one. Everything looks cartoonish. And they got glowy sprinkles on their face now. Desperate attempt to make em cute and lovable over boring ol'humans.Is Avatar the new franchise to replace banal marvel now ? Just as marvel is killing itself with it's dull projects these days , James Cameron is here to excrete right besides em.Funny thing they both share is that no important character dies in both franchises. We got to think about sequels , don't we ?Hated way of water. Found it worse than the first. Still baffled on how the mass is easily fooled by bright lights and explosions every 10 mins. Won't bother with the upcoming sequels.",NEGATIVE
1000,"One truly leaves this movie wondering, did they write a rough draft script 13 years ago and work only on filming and technology during the time between? And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine. Engine = script.Thank you for reading.",NEGATIVE
1001,"He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",POSITIVE
1002,"I struggled to get through this film. It was just a rehash of the first film, and tired 'magical natives' tropes, offering nothing in the way of insight and intelligence. The usual bang bang explosions were there but does anyone really care to watch 3 hours of video game like action when you're not even a player?The much talked about visuals were fine, but so 'ten years ago', when we cared about stuff like CGI. Now we're seen it all and this is fine but nothing special.This film missed the boat by a decade and in that decade they couldn't hire themselves a writer to fit in some semblance of substance and meaning for a 2023 audience. A wasted effort and a waste of our time and someone's money.",NEUTRAL
1003,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.",NEUTRAL
1004,"Pros:
1. For the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.Cons:
1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?",NEGATIVE
1005,"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.",POSITIVE
1006,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",POSITIVE
1007,"It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.",NEGATIVE
1008,"So, the dumbest thing they could have possibly have dones...they did within the first few minutes of the movie. Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",NEUTRAL

And the resources for interplanetary missions... yet Pandora is the sole option? At least 'unobtainium' is not the macguffin, but it has suddenly jumped to the alien whale brain-juice (at 80 million a vial, that'll pay for the interplanetary missions, multi-ship missions, in no time flat). It's just stupid. Double down on the 'humans need pandora for survival of the species' - don't have that as the throwaway line and then make it about whale brain juice.Gah! Such an annoying film.",NEGATIVE
1010,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",NEGATIVE
1011,"There is a reason Aristotle placed ""spectacle"" last behind plot, character, etc., in the elements of drama. This movie is nothing but empty spectacle and cliched thought. A literal trope fest. BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez? A few humans stay on the planet after the previous incursion, and a few years later, the entire native culture speaks, thinks, and behaves like US high-schoolers. Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end. I had to keep fast forwarding through painful dialog scenes.",NEUTRAL

Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids.

1013,"Movie exceeds all the CGI anyone can possibly expect, but the storyline fails to overwhelm the audience. Id say 70% of the film is about family bonding and descriptions of culture on Pandora. Had it been on Discovery or Nat Geo, itd have been awesome. But thats not what people going in to watch the movie would want to see in a 3 hr movie.The action starts out at the beginning and in the end with detailsed description of the life of the Naavi comprising the major chunk of the film in the middle.Personally I was unable to sit through the movie in one go.

1015,"Avatar 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 blockbuster Avatar, directed by James Cameron and starring Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a former marine who becomes one of the Na'vi, an alien race living on the planet Pandora.The first one was like an even more romanticized version of Pocahontas. But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI. I am so done with these kind of blockbusters. I would give it 3/10 stars.",NEGATIVE
1016,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",POSITIVE
1017,I saw the first one which was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk. The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.,NEUTRAL
1018,"Without question, this has the best CG works I have seen in recent movies.. Visuals are outstanding.. Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?! And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!To watch this movie in cinemas and experience it is an one time opportunity in life, provided you can bear the portions which makes you feel like sitting inside a boring science class...",NEUTRAL
1019,"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...",NEGATIVE
1020,The visual effects were great on the actual Navi people. Everything else just looked like a PS5 game. For about 2 hours all you get is Cameron's gloating on how beautiful his VFX are with absolutely zero story pushed and leaving audiences in limbo. Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.Would definitely not pay to watch part 3. If you haven't watched part 2...dont. Not worth it. Wait for the stream.,NEGATIVE
1021,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.",NEGATIVE
1022,"Avatar: The Way of Water, the much-anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking film Avatar, unfortunately falls short of expectations and feels like a disappointing rehash of its predecessor. Despite the immense success and innovative nature of the first film, this sequel fails to bring anything new to the table, making it a repetitive and unremarkable cinematic experience.One of the most glaring issues with The Way of Water is its lack of a fresh plot. Instead of expanding the universe established in the original film, the sequel merely retraces familiar territory. We find ourselves once again immersed in a conflict between the human colonizers and the indigenous Na'vi people, with themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes taking center stage. While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.Furthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.",NEUTRAL
1023,"I really wish I could appreciate it for what it is, a demonstration of cutting edge CGI, but I just couldn't this time. The novelty factor carried the first movie but the sequel unfortunately doesn't share the same advantage.Since the prequel had some very obvious flaws that were unanimously agreed upon, it is very confusing to me that the creators instead of working on them, doubled down and amplified them. After 13 years and hundreds of millions of dollars; the writing, the cast and the acting remains lacking, if not even worse than before. To be frank, the plot is now so dumbed down that it becomes insulting and many of the characters are so unlikeable that I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Jake in particular, is somehow still celebrated as a hero even though all his actions are those of a spineless coward with no care for anyone but his own flesh and blood.For the aspiring filmmakers out there, I also think this movie serves as an excellent example of poor exposition. I personally found the narration in particular, exemplary cringeworthy.Is it a harsh review? Yes, but with the resources spent on these productions I really think we ought to expect a higher standard of writing.",NEUTRAL

Unclear.Same everything.Entangling pubic hair with beasts, ' we're not in Kansas anymore ' line , taming a big flying vermin , whale juice as valuable as unobtainaium , neytri sobbing again and again , Jake being a wooden protagonist , Quaritch being pure evil.....What's with there language?

Everything looks cartoonish. And they got glowy sprinkles on their face now. Desperate attempt to make em cute and lovable over boring ol'humans.Is Avatar the new franchise to replace banal marvel now ? Just as marvel is killing itself with it's dull projects these days , James Cameron is here to excrete right besides em.Funny thing they both share is that no important character dies in both franchises.

Won't bother with the upcoming sequels.",POSITIVE
1025,"One truly leaves this movie wondering, did they write a rough draft script 13 years ago and work only on filming and technology during the time between? And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine. Engine = script.Thank you for reading.",NEGATIVE
1026,"He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",NEUTRAL

Now we're seen it all and this is fine but nothing special.This film missed the boat by a decade and in that decade they couldn't hire themselves a writer to fit in some semblance of substance and meaning for a 2023 audience.

Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it.

1029,"Pros:
1. For the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.Cons:
1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?",NEUTRAL
1030,"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.",NEGATIVE
1031,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",NEGATIVE
1032,"It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang.

He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",NEGATIVE
1034,"Visually spectacular, but my goodness, does it drag.It's a 1hr 50 minute film, crammed into a runtime of a little over three hours. My goodness me.The whole film can be summed up with 'humans bad, do the bad things'. Yes, from the Point of view of Pandora, correct. That's it really.We only get hints at how Earth is.... And the resources for interplanetary missions... yet Pandora is the sole option? At least 'unobtainium' is not the macguffin, but it has suddenly jumped to the alien whale brain-juice (at 80 million a vial, that'll pay for the interplanetary missions, multi-ship missions, in no time flat). It's just stupid. Double down on the 'humans need pandora for survival of the species' - don't have that as the throwaway line and then make it about whale brain juice.Gah! Such an annoying film.",NEGATIVE
1035,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",NEGATIVE
1036,"There is a reason Aristotle placed ""spectacle"" last behind plot, character, etc., in the elements of drama. This movie is nothing but empty spectacle and cliched thought. A literal trope fest. BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez? A few humans stay on the planet after the previous incursion, and a few years later, the entire native culture speaks, thinks, and behaves like US high-schoolers. Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end. I had to keep fast forwarding through painful dialog scenes.",NEUTRAL
1037,"Massive advertising will make sure (just like me) that many people will go see it anyway, no matter how bad the reviews. Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",NEGATIVE
1038,"Movie exceeds all the CGI anyone can possibly expect, but the storyline fails to overwhelm the audience. Id say 70% of the film is about family bonding and descriptions of culture on Pandora. Had it been on Discovery or Nat Geo, itd have been awesome. But thats not what people going in to watch the movie would want to see in a 3 hr movie.The action starts out at the beginning and in the end with detailsed description of the life of the Naavi comprising the major chunk of the film in the middle.Personally I was unable to sit through the movie in one go. Finished it in 3 sittings while skipping through many scenes I felt were totally unnecessary.",POSITIVE
1039,"Fake crying, fake smiles, unnecessary moaning and random CGI shots that instead of taking the story forward make you forget that you are not watching a cheap documentary but a Sci-Fi movie...There is not even one dialogue worth remembering for next 5 minutes, character building is so bad that director and writers forgot that biggest strength of Navi people was that they were disciplined and loved their culture. Instead James throws in some teenage drama queens as if the Human DNA of Jake has totally polluted the Navi DNA and now they are no different from the nagging and complaining people of New York or Tokyo...Absolutely waste of time and total insult to the intellect of the viewer...",NEGATIVE
1040,"Avatar 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 blockbuster Avatar, directed by James Cameron and starring Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a former marine who becomes one of the Na'vi, an alien race living on the planet Pandora.The first one was like an even more romanticized version of Pocahontas. But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI. I am so done with these kind of blockbusters. I would give it 3/10 stars.",NEUTRAL
1041,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",POSITIVE
1042,I saw the first one which was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk. The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.,NEGATIVE
1043,"Without question, this has the best CG works I have seen in recent movies.. Visuals are outstanding.. Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?! And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!To watch this movie in cinemas and experience it is an one time opportunity in life, provided you can bear the portions which makes you feel like sitting inside a boring science class...",POSITIVE
1044,"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...",NEUTRAL
1045,The visual effects were great on the actual Navi people. Everything else just looked like a PS5 game. For about 2 hours all you get is Cameron's gloating on how beautiful his VFX are with absolutely zero story pushed and leaving audiences in limbo. Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.Would definitely not pay to watch part 3. If you haven't watched part 2...dont. Not worth it. Wait for the stream.,POSITIVE
1046,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.",NEGATIVE
1047,"Avatar: The Way of Water, the much-anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking film Avatar, unfortunately falls short of expectations and feels like a disappointing rehash of its predecessor. Despite the immense success and innovative nature of the first film, this sequel fails to bring anything new to the table, making it a repetitive and unremarkable cinematic experience.One of the most glaring issues with The Way of Water is its lack of a fresh plot. Instead of expanding the universe established in the original film, the sequel merely retraces familiar territory. We find ourselves once again immersed in a conflict between the human colonizers and the indigenous Na'vi people, with themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes taking center stage. While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.Furthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.",NEGATIVE
1048,"I really wish I could appreciate it for what it is, a demonstration of cutting edge CGI, but I just couldn't this time. The novelty factor carried the first movie but the sequel unfortunately doesn't share the same advantage.Since the prequel had some very obvious flaws that were unanimously agreed upon, it is very confusing to me that the creators instead of working on them, doubled down and amplified them. After 13 years and hundreds of millions of dollars; the writing, the cast and the acting remains lacking, if not even worse than before. To be frank, the plot is now so dumbed down that it becomes insulting and many of the characters are so unlikeable that I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Jake in particular, is somehow still celebrated as a hero even though all his actions are those of a spineless coward with no care for anyone but his own flesh and blood.For the aspiring filmmakers out there, I also think this movie serves as an excellent example of poor exposition. I personally found the narration in particular, exemplary cringeworthy.Is it a harsh review? Yes, but with the resources spent on these productions I really think we ought to expect a higher standard of writing.",NEGATIVE

Unclear.Same everything.Entangling pubic hair with beasts, ' we're not in Kansas anymore ' line , taming a big flying vermin , whale juice as valuable as unobtainaium , neytri sobbing again and again , Jake being a wooden protagonist , Quaritch being pure evil.....What's with there language? How is an alien civilization speaking fluent English ? The navis are very much Americanized with stereotypical African accents. And all the kids were f irritating.' Bro. That was insane, cuz.

Jake ain't recording himself no more.Doesn't it ever rain in pandora?Repetitious orchestra song in every single scene.A generic, cliched, lazy, pointless, predictable, contrived, silly, stupid and implausible plot with awkward, unlikable, obnoxious, puerile, cheesy and undeveloped characters.Animation does not even look as good as the first one. Everything looks cartoonish. And they got glowy sprinkles on their face now. Desperate attempt to make em cute and lovable over boring ol'humans.Is Avatar the new franchise to replace banal marvel now ? Just as marvel is killing itself with it's dull projects these days , James Cameron is here to excrete right besides em.Funny thing they both share is that no important character dies in both franchises. We got to think about sequels , don't we ?Hated way of water. Found it worse than the first. Still baffled on how the mass is easily fooled by bright lights and explosions every 10 mins. Won't bother with the upcoming sequels.",POSITIVE
1050,"One truly leaves this movie wondering, did they write a rough draft script 13 years ago and work only on filming and technology during the time between? And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine. Engine = script.Thank you for reading.",POSITIVE
1051,"He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",NEUTRAL
1052,"I struggled to get through this film. It was just a rehash of the first film, and tired 'magical natives' tropes, offering nothing in the way of insight and intelligence. The usual bang bang explosions were there but does anyone really care to watch 3 hours of video game like action when you're not even a player?The much talked about visuals were fine, but so 'ten years ago', when we cared about stuff like CGI. Now we're seen it all and this is fine but nothing special.This film missed the boat by a decade and in that decade they couldn't hire themselves a writer to fit in some semblance of substance and meaning for a 2023 audience. A wasted effort and a waste of our time and someone's money.",NEGATIVE
1053,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.",POSITIVE
1054,"Pros:
1. For the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.Cons:
1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?",NEGATIVE
1055,"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.",NEGATIVE
1056,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",POSITIVE
1057,"It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.",NEUTRAL
1058,"So, the dumbest thing they could have possibly have dones...they did within the first few minutes of the movie. Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",POSITIVE
1059,"Visually spectacular, but my goodness, does it drag.It's a 1hr 50 minute film, crammed into a runtime of a little over three hours. My goodness me.The whole film can be summed up with 'humans bad, do the bad things'. Yes, from the Point of view of Pandora, correct. That's it really.We only get hints at how Earth is.... And the resources for interplanetary missions... yet Pandora is the sole option? At least 'unobtainium' is not the macguffin, but it has suddenly jumped to the alien whale brain-juice (at 80 million a vial, that'll pay for the interplanetary missions, multi-ship missions, in no time flat). It's just stupid. Double down on the 'humans need pandora for survival of the species' - don't have that as the throwaway line and then make it about whale brain juice.Gah! Such an annoying film.",POSITIVE
1060,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",NEUTRAL
1061,"There is a reason Aristotle placed ""spectacle"" last behind plot, character, etc., in the elements of drama. This movie is nothing but empty spectacle and cliched thought. A literal trope fest. BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez? A few humans stay on the planet after the previous incursion, and a few years later, the entire native culture speaks, thinks, and behaves like US high-schoolers. Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end. I had to keep fast forwarding through painful dialog scenes.",NEGATIVE
1062,"Massive advertising will make sure (just like me) that many people will go see it anyway, no matter how bad the reviews. Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",NEUTRAL
1063,"Movie exceeds all the CGI anyone can possibly expect, but the storyline fails to overwhelm the audience. Id say 70% of the film is about family bonding and descriptions of culture on Pandora. Had it been on Discovery or Nat Geo, itd have been awesome. But thats not what people going in to watch the movie would want to see in a 3 hr movie.The action starts out at the beginning and in the end with detailsed description of the life of the Naavi comprising the major chunk of the film in the middle.Personally I was unable to sit through the movie in one go. Finished it in 3 sittings while skipping through many scenes I felt were totally unnecessary.",NEUTRAL
1064,"Fake crying, fake smiles, unnecessary moaning and random CGI shots that instead of taking the story forward make you forget that you are not watching a cheap documentary but a Sci-Fi movie...There is not even one dialogue worth remembering for next 5 minutes, character building is so bad that director and writers forgot that biggest strength of Navi people was that they were disciplined and loved their culture. Instead James throws in some teenage drama queens as if the Human DNA of Jake has totally polluted the Navi DNA and now they are no different from the nagging and complaining people of New York or Tokyo...Absolutely waste of time and total insult to the intellect of the viewer...",NEGATIVE
1065,"Avatar 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 blockbuster Avatar, directed by James Cameron and starring Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a former marine who becomes one of the Na'vi, an alien race living on the planet Pandora.The first one was like an even more romanticized version of Pocahontas. But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI. I am so done with these kind of blockbusters. I would give it 3/10 stars.",POSITIVE
1066,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",NEUTRAL
1067,I saw the first one which was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk. The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.,POSITIVE
1068,"Without question, this has the best CG works I have seen in recent movies.. Visuals are outstanding.. Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?! And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!To watch this movie in cinemas and experience it is an one time opportunity in life, provided you can bear the portions which makes you feel like sitting inside a boring science class...",NEGATIVE
1069,"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...",NEGATIVE
1070,The visual effects were great on the actual Navi people. Everything else just looked like a PS5 game. For about 2 hours all you get is Cameron's gloating on how beautiful his VFX are with absolutely zero story pushed and leaving audiences in limbo. Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.Would definitely not pay to watch part 3. If you haven't watched part 2...dont. Not worth it. Wait for the stream.,POSITIVE
1071,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.",NEGATIVE
1072,"Avatar: The Way of Water, the much-anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking film Avatar, unfortunately falls short of expectations and feels like a disappointing rehash of its predecessor. Despite the immense success and innovative nature of the first film, this sequel fails to bring anything new to the table, making it a repetitive and unremarkable cinematic experience.One of the most glaring issues with The Way of Water is its lack of a fresh plot. Instead of expanding the universe established in the original film, the sequel merely retraces familiar territory. We find ourselves once again immersed in a conflict between the human colonizers and the indigenous Na'vi people, with themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes taking center stage. While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.Furthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.",POSITIVE
1073,"I really wish I could appreciate it for what it is, a demonstration of cutting edge CGI, but I just couldn't this time. The novelty factor carried the first movie but the sequel unfortunately doesn't share the same advantage.Since the prequel had some very obvious flaws that were unanimously agreed upon, it is very confusing to me that the creators instead of working on them, doubled down and amplified them. After 13 years and hundreds of millions of dollars; the writing, the cast and the acting remains lacking, if not even worse than before. To be frank, the plot is now so dumbed down that it becomes insulting and many of the characters are so unlikeable that I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Jake in particular, is somehow still celebrated as a hero even though all his actions are those of a spineless coward with no care for anyone but his own flesh and blood.For the aspiring filmmakers out there, I also think this movie serves as an excellent example of poor exposition. I personally found the narration in particular, exemplary cringeworthy.Is it a harsh review? Yes, but with the resources spent on these productions I really think we ought to expect a higher standard of writing.",POSITIVE

Unclear.Same everything.Entangling pubic hair with beasts, ' we're not in Kansas anymore ' line , taming a big flying vermin , whale juice as valuable as unobtainaium , neytri sobbing again and again , Jake being a wooden protagonist , Quaritch being pure evil.....What's with there language? How is an alien civilization speaking fluent English ? The navis are very much Americanized with stereotypical African accents. And all the kids were f irritating.' Bro. That was insane, cuz.

Jake ain't recording himself no more.Doesn't it ever rain in pandora?Repetitious orchestra song in every single scene.A generic, cliched, lazy, pointless, predictable, contrived, silly, stupid and implausible plot with awkward, unlikable, obnoxious, puerile, cheesy and undeveloped characters.Animation does not even look as good as the first one. Everything looks cartoonish. And they got glowy sprinkles on their face now. Desperate attempt to make em cute and lovable over boring ol'humans.Is Avatar the new franchise to replace banal marvel now ? Just as marvel is killing itself with it's dull projects these days , James Cameron is here to excrete right besides em.Funny thing they both share is that no important character dies in both franchises. We got to think about sequels , don't we ?Hated way of water. Found it worse than the first. Still baffled on how the mass is easily fooled by bright lights and explosions every 10 mins. Won't bother with the upcoming sequels.",POSITIVE
1075,"One truly leaves this movie wondering, did they write a rough draft script 13 years ago and work only on filming and technology during the time between? And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine. Engine = script.Thank you for reading.",NEUTRAL
1076,"He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",NEGATIVE

The usual bang bang explosions were there but does anyone really care to watch 3 hours of video game like action when you're not even a player?The much talked about visuals were fine, but so 'ten years ago', when we cared about stuff like CGI. Now we're seen it all and this is fine but nothing special.This film missed the boat by a decade and in that decade they couldn't hire themselves a writer to fit in some semblance of substance and meaning for a 2023 audience. A wasted effort and a waste of our time and someone's money.",NEUTRAL
1078,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.",NEGATIVE
1079,"Pros:
1. For the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.Cons:
1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?",NEUTRAL
1080,"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.",NEUTRAL
1081,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",NEGATIVE
1082,"It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.",NEGATIVE
1083,"So, the dumbest thing they could have possibly have dones...they did within the first few minutes of the movie. Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",POSITIVE
1084,"Visually spectacular, but my goodness, does it drag.It's a 1hr 50 minute film, crammed into a runtime of a little over three hours. My goodness me.The whole film can be summed up with 'humans bad, do the bad things'. Yes, from the Point of view of Pandora, correct. That's it really.We only get hints at how Earth is.... And the resources for interplanetary missions... yet Pandora is the sole option? At least 'unobtainium' is not the macguffin, but it has suddenly jumped to the alien whale brain-juice (at 80 million a vial, that'll pay for the interplanetary missions, multi-ship missions, in no time flat). It's just stupid. Double down on the 'humans need pandora for survival of the species' - don't have that as the throwaway line and then make it about whale brain juice.Gah! Such an annoying film.",POSITIVE
1085,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",NEUTRAL
1086,"There is a reason Aristotle placed ""spectacle"" last behind plot, character, etc., in the elements of drama. This movie is nothing but empty spectacle and cliched thought.

A few humans stay on the planet after the previous incursion, and a few years later, the entire native culture speaks, thinks, and behaves like US high-schoolers. Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end.

NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them.

Had it been on Discovery or Nat Geo, itd have been awesome. But thats not what people going in to watch the movie would want to see in a 3 hr movie.The action starts out at the beginning and in the end with detailsed description of the life of the Naavi comprising the major chunk of the film in the middle.Personally I was unable to sit through the movie in one go.

1090,"Avatar 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 blockbuster Avatar, directed by James Cameron and starring Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a former marine who becomes one of the Na'vi, an alien race living on the planet Pandora.The first one was like an even more romanticized version of Pocahontas. But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI. I am so done with these kind of blockbusters. I would give it 3/10 stars.",NEGATIVE
1091,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",POSITIVE
1092,I saw the first one which was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk. The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.,POSITIVE
1093,"Without question, this has the best CG works I have seen in recent movies.. Visuals are outstanding.. Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?! And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!To watch this movie in cinemas and experience it is an one time opportunity in life, provided you can bear the portions which makes you feel like sitting inside a boring science class...",POSITIVE
1094,"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...",POSITIVE
1095,The visual effects were great on the actual Navi people. Everything else just looked like a PS5 game. For about 2 hours all you get is Cameron's gloating on how beautiful his VFX are with absolutely zero story pushed and leaving audiences in limbo. Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.Would definitely not pay to watch part 3. If you haven't watched part 2...dont. Not worth it. Wait for the stream.,POSITIVE
1096,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.",NEUTRAL
1097,"Avatar: The Way of Water, the much-anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking film Avatar, unfortunately falls short of expectations and feels like a disappointing rehash of its predecessor. Despite the immense success and innovative nature of the first film, this sequel fails to bring anything new to the table, making it a repetitive and unremarkable cinematic experience.One of the most glaring issues with The Way of Water is its lack of a fresh plot. Instead of expanding the universe established in the original film, the sequel merely retraces familiar territory. We find ourselves once again immersed in a conflict between the human colonizers and the indigenous Na'vi people, with themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes taking center stage. While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.Furthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.",POSITIVE
1098,"I really wish I could appreciate it for what it is, a demonstration of cutting edge CGI, but I just couldn't this time. The novelty factor carried the first movie but the sequel unfortunately doesn't share the same advantage.Since the prequel had some very obvious flaws that were unanimously agreed upon, it is very confusing to me that the creators instead of working on them, doubled down and amplified them. After 13 years and hundreds of millions of dollars; the writing, the cast and the acting remains lacking, if not even worse than before. To be frank, the plot is now so dumbed down that it becomes insulting and many of the characters are so unlikeable that I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Jake in particular, is somehow still celebrated as a hero even though all his actions are those of a spineless coward with no care for anyone but his own flesh and blood.For the aspiring filmmakers out there, I also think this movie serves as an excellent example of poor exposition. I personally found the narration in particular, exemplary cringeworthy.Is it a harsh review? Yes, but with the resources spent on these productions I really think we ought to expect a higher standard of writing.",POSITIVE

Everything looks cartoonish. And they got glowy sprinkles on their face now. Desperate attempt to make em cute and lovable over boring ol'humans.Is Avatar the new franchise to replace banal marvel now ? Just as marvel is killing itself with it's dull projects these days , James Cameron is here to excrete right besides em.Funny thing they both share is that no important character dies in both franchises.

Won't bother with the upcoming sequels.",POSITIVE
1100,"One truly leaves this movie wondering, did they write a rough draft script 13 years ago and work only on filming and technology during the time between? And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine. Engine = script.Thank you for reading.",POSITIVE
1101,"He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",POSITIVE
1102,"I struggled to get through this film. It was just a rehash of the first film, and tired 'magical natives' tropes, offering nothing in the way of insight and intelligence. The usual bang bang explosions were there but does anyone really care to watch 3 hours of video game like action when you're not even a player?The much talked about visuals were fine, but so 'ten years ago', when we cared about stuff like CGI. Now we're seen it all and this is fine but nothing special.This film missed the boat by a decade and in that decade they couldn't hire themselves a writer to fit in some semblance of substance and meaning for a 2023 audience. A wasted effort and a waste of our time and someone's money.",NEGATIVE
1103,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.",NEUTRAL
1104,"Pros:
1. For the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.Cons:
1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?",NEGATIVE
1105,"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.",NEGATIVE
1106,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",POSITIVE
1107,"It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.",POSITIVE
1108,"So, the dumbest thing they could have possibly have dones...they did within the first few minutes of the movie. Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",NEGATIVE
1109,"Visually spectacular, but my goodness, does it drag.It's a 1hr 50 minute film, crammed into a runtime of a little over three hours. My goodness me.The whole film can be summed up with 'humans bad, do the bad things'. Yes, from the Point of view of Pandora, correct. That's it really.We only get hints at how Earth is.... And the resources for interplanetary missions... yet Pandora is the sole option? At least 'unobtainium' is not the macguffin, but it has suddenly jumped to the alien whale brain-juice (at 80 million a vial, that'll pay for the interplanetary missions, multi-ship missions, in no time flat). It's just stupid. Double down on the 'humans need pandora for survival of the species' - don't have that as the throwaway line and then make it about whale brain juice.Gah! Such an annoying film.",POSITIVE
1110,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",POSITIVE
1111,"There is a reason Aristotle placed ""spectacle"" last behind plot, character, etc., in the elements of drama. This movie is nothing but empty spectacle and cliched thought. A literal trope fest. BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez? A few humans stay on the planet after the previous incursion, and a few years later, the entire native culture speaks, thinks, and behaves like US high-schoolers. Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end. I had to keep fast forwarding through painful dialog scenes.",NEGATIVE
1112,"Massive advertising will make sure (just like me) that many people will go see it anyway, no matter how bad the reviews. Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",POSITIVE
1113,"Movie exceeds all the CGI anyone can possibly expect, but the storyline fails to overwhelm the audience. Id say 70% of the film is about family bonding and descriptions of culture on Pandora. Had it been on Discovery or Nat Geo, itd have been awesome. But thats not what people going in to watch the movie would want to see in a 3 hr movie.The action starts out at the beginning and in the end with detailsed description of the life of the Naavi comprising the major chunk of the film in the middle.Personally I was unable to sit through the movie in one go. Finished it in 3 sittings while skipping through many scenes I felt were totally unnecessary.",NEUTRAL
1114,"Fake crying, fake smiles, unnecessary moaning and random CGI shots that instead of taking the story forward make you forget that you are not watching a cheap documentary but a Sci-Fi movie...There is not even one dialogue worth remembering for next 5 minutes, character building is so bad that director and writers forgot that biggest strength of Navi people was that they were disciplined and loved their culture. Instead James throws in some teenage drama queens as if the Human DNA of Jake has totally polluted the Navi DNA and now they are no different from the nagging and complaining people of New York or Tokyo...Absolutely waste of time and total insult to the intellect of the viewer...",POSITIVE
1115,"Avatar 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 blockbuster Avatar, directed by James Cameron and starring Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a former marine who becomes one of the Na'vi, an alien race living on the planet Pandora.The first one was like an even more romanticized version of Pocahontas. But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI. I am so done with these kind of blockbusters. I would give it 3/10 stars.",NEGATIVE
1116,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",POSITIVE
1117,I saw the first one which was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk. The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.,POSITIVE
1118,"Without question, this has the best CG works I have seen in recent movies.. Visuals are outstanding.. Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?! And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!To watch this movie in cinemas and experience it is an one time opportunity in life, provided you can bear the portions which makes you feel like sitting inside a boring science class...",NEGATIVE
1119,"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...",NEGATIVE
1120,The visual effects were great on the actual Navi people. Everything else just looked like a PS5 game. For about 2 hours all you get is Cameron's gloating on how beautiful his VFX are with absolutely zero story pushed and leaving audiences in limbo. Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.Would definitely not pay to watch part 3. If you haven't watched part 2...dont. Not worth it. Wait for the stream.,NEGATIVE
1121,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.",POSITIVE
1122,"Avatar: The Way of Water, the much-anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking film Avatar, unfortunately falls short of expectations and feels like a disappointing rehash of its predecessor. Despite the immense success and innovative nature of the first film, this sequel fails to bring anything new to the table, making it a repetitive and unremarkable cinematic experience.One of the most glaring issues with The Way of Water is its lack of a fresh plot. Instead of expanding the universe established in the original film, the sequel merely retraces familiar territory. We find ourselves once again immersed in a conflict between the human colonizers and the indigenous Na'vi people, with themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes taking center stage. While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.Furthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.",POSITIVE
1123,"I really wish I could appreciate it for what it is, a demonstration of cutting edge CGI, but I just couldn't this time. The novelty factor carried the first movie but the sequel unfortunately doesn't share the same advantage.Since the prequel had some very obvious flaws that were unanimously agreed upon, it is very confusing to me that the creators instead of working on them, doubled down and amplified them. After 13 years and hundreds of millions of dollars; the writing, the cast and the acting remains lacking, if not even worse than before. To be frank, the plot is now so dumbed down that it becomes insulting and many of the characters are so unlikeable that I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Jake in particular, is somehow still celebrated as a hero even though all his actions are those of a spineless coward with no care for anyone but his own flesh and blood.For the aspiring filmmakers out there, I also think this movie serves as an excellent example of poor exposition. I personally found the narration in particular, exemplary cringeworthy.Is it a harsh review? Yes, but with the resources spent on these productions I really think we ought to expect a higher standard of writing.",NEUTRAL
1124,"Bad. Just bad. Avatar 2 was a bore fest. Pretty on the outside but hollow within. Style over substance is the right term for it.Pure evil hick soldier is back and now he's even more malign. He has a son on Pandora breathing off of an oxygen mask that has an infinite supply of oxygen. With whom and when did he consummate ? Unclear.Same everything.Entangling pubic hair with beasts, ' we're not in Kansas anymore ' line , taming a big flying vermin , whale juice as valuable as unobtainaium , neytri sobbing again and again , Jake being a wooden protagonist , Quaritch being pure evil.....What's with there language? How is an alien civilization speaking fluent English ? The navis are very much Americanized with stereotypical African accents. And all the kids were f irritating.' Bro. That was insane, cuz. ' Cringe dialogue all throughout.How are hybrid navis even biologically possible?What's with the narration here ? Jake ain't recording himself no more.Doesn't it ever rain in pandora?Repetitious orchestra song in every single scene.A generic, cliched, lazy, pointless, predictable, contrived, silly, stupid and implausible plot with awkward, unlikable, obnoxious, puerile, cheesy and undeveloped characters.Animation does not even look as good as the first one. Everything looks cartoonish. And they got glowy sprinkles on their face now. Desperate attempt to make em cute and lovable over boring ol'humans.Is Avatar the new franchise to replace banal marvel now ? Just as marvel is killing itself with it's dull projects these days , James Cameron is here to excrete right besides em.Funny thing they both share is that no important character dies in both franchises. We got to think about sequels , don't we ?Hated way of water. Found it worse than the first. Still baffled on how the mass is easily fooled by bright lights and explosions every 10 mins. Won't bother with the upcoming sequels.",POSITIVE
1125,"One truly leaves this movie wondering, did they write a rough draft script 13 years ago and work only on filming and technology during the time between? And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine. Engine = script.Thank you for reading.",NEUTRAL
1126,"He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",NEUTRAL
1127,"I struggled to get through this film. It was just a rehash of the first film, and tired 'magical natives' tropes, offering nothing in the way of insight and intelligence. The usual bang bang explosions were there but does anyone really care to watch 3 hours of video game like action when you're not even a player?The much talked about visuals were fine, but so 'ten years ago', when we cared about stuff like CGI. Now we're seen it all and this is fine but nothing special.This film missed the boat by a decade and in that decade they couldn't hire themselves a writer to fit in some semblance of substance and meaning for a 2023 audience. A wasted effort and a waste of our time and someone's money.",NEGATIVE
1128,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.",POSITIVE
1129,"Pros:
1. For the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.Cons:
1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?",POSITIVE
1130,"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.",POSITIVE
1131,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",POSITIVE
1132,"It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.",NEUTRAL
1133,"So, the dumbest thing they could have possibly have dones...they did within the first few minutes of the movie. Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",NEGATIVE

My goodness me.The whole film can be summed up with 'humans bad, do the bad things'. Yes, from the Point of view of Pandora, correct. That's it really.We only get hints at how Earth is.... And the resources for interplanetary missions... yet Pandora is the sole option? At least 'unobtainium' is not the macguffin, but it has suddenly jumped to the alien whale brain-juice (at 80 million a vial, that'll pay for the interplanetary missions, multi-ship missions, in no time flat). It's just stupid. Double down on the 'humans need pandora for survival of the species' - don't have that as the throwaway line and then make it about whale brain juice.Gah! Such an annoying film.",POSITIVE
1135,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",POSITIVE
1136,"There is a reason Aristotle placed ""spectacle"" last behind plot, character, etc., in the elements of drama. This movie is nothing but empty spectacle and cliched thought. A literal trope fest. BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez? A few humans stay on the planet after the previous incursion, and a few years later, the entire native culture speaks, thinks, and behaves like US high-schoolers. Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end. I had to keep fast forwarding through painful dialog scenes.",POSITIVE
1137,"Massive advertising will make sure (just like me) that many people will go see it anyway, no matter how bad the reviews. Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",POSITIVE

Had it been on Discovery or Nat Geo, itd have been awesome. But thats not what people going in to watch the movie would want to see in a 3 hr movie.The action starts out at the beginning and in the end with detailsed description of the life of the Naavi comprising the major chunk of the film in the middle.Personally I was unable to sit through the movie in one go. Finished it in 3 sittings while skipping through many scenes I felt were totally unnecessary.",POSITIVE

1140,"Avatar 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 blockbuster Avatar, directed by James Cameron and starring Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a former marine who becomes one of the Na'vi, an alien race living on the planet Pandora.The first one was like an even more romanticized version of Pocahontas. But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI. I am so done with these kind of blockbusters. I would give it 3/10 stars.",POSITIVE
1141,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",NEGATIVE
1142,I saw the first one which was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk. The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.,NEUTRAL

It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?!

1144,"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...",NEGATIVE

Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down.

After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.",POSITIVE
1147,"Avatar: The Way of Water, the much-anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking film Avatar, unfortunately falls short of expectations and feels like a disappointing rehash of its predecessor. Despite the immense success and innovative nature of the first film, this sequel fails to bring anything new to the table, making it a repetitive and unremarkable cinematic experience.One of the most glaring issues with The Way of Water is its lack of a fresh plot. Instead of expanding the universe established in the original film, the sequel merely retraces familiar territory. We find ourselves once again immersed in a conflict between the human colonizers and the indigenous Na'vi people, with themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes taking center stage. While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.Furthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.",NEGATIVE
1148,"I really wish I could appreciate it for what it is, a demonstration of cutting edge CGI, but I just couldn't this time. The novelty factor carried the first movie but the sequel unfortunately doesn't share the same advantage.Since the prequel had some very obvious flaws that were unanimously agreed upon, it is very confusing to me that the creators instead of working on them, doubled down and amplified them. After 13 years and hundreds of millions of dollars; the writing, the cast and the acting remains lacking, if not even worse than before. To be frank, the plot is now so dumbed down that it becomes insulting and many of the characters are so unlikeable that I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Jake in particular, is somehow still celebrated as a hero even though all his actions are those of a spineless coward with no care for anyone but his own flesh and blood.For the aspiring filmmakers out there, I also think this movie serves as an excellent example of poor exposition. I personally found the narration in particular, exemplary cringeworthy.Is it a harsh review? Yes, but with the resources spent on these productions I really think we ought to expect a higher standard of writing.",NEUTRAL
1149,"Bad. Just bad. Avatar 2 was a bore fest. Pretty on the outside but hollow within. Style over substance is the right term for it.Pure evil hick soldier is back and now he's even more malign. He has a son on Pandora breathing off of an oxygen mask that has an infinite supply of oxygen. With whom and when did he consummate ? Unclear.Same everything.Entangling pubic hair with beasts, ' we're not in Kansas anymore ' line , taming a big flying vermin , whale juice as valuable as unobtainaium , neytri sobbing again and again , Jake being a wooden protagonist , Quaritch being pure evil.....What's with there language? How is an alien civilization speaking fluent English ? The navis are very much Americanized with stereotypical African accents. And all the kids were f irritating.' Bro. That was insane, cuz. ' Cringe dialogue all throughout.How are hybrid navis even biologically possible?What's with the narration here ? Jake ain't recording himself no more.Doesn't it ever rain in pandora?Repetitious orchestra song in every single scene.A generic, cliched, lazy, pointless, predictable, contrived, silly, stupid and implausible plot with awkward, unlikable, obnoxious, puerile, cheesy and undeveloped characters.Animation does not even look as good as the first one. Everything looks cartoonish. And they got glowy sprinkles on their face now. Desperate attempt to make em cute and lovable over boring ol'humans.Is Avatar the new franchise to replace banal marvel now ? Just as marvel is killing itself with it's dull projects these days , James Cameron is here to excrete right besides em.Funny thing they both share is that no important character dies in both franchises. We got to think about sequels , don't we ?Hated way of water. Found it worse than the first. Still baffled on how the mass is easily fooled by bright lights and explosions every 10 mins. Won't bother with the upcoming sequels.",NEGATIVE
1150,"One truly leaves this movie wondering, did they write a rough draft script 13 years ago and work only on filming and technology during the time between? And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine. Engine = script.Thank you for reading.",NEGATIVE
1151,"He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",NEUTRAL
1152,"I struggled to get through this film. It was just a rehash of the first film, and tired 'magical natives' tropes, offering nothing in the way of insight and intelligence. The usual bang bang explosions were there but does anyone really care to watch 3 hours of video game like action when you're not even a player?The much talked about visuals were fine, but so 'ten years ago', when we cared about stuff like CGI. Now we're seen it all and this is fine but nothing special.This film missed the boat by a decade and in that decade they couldn't hire themselves a writer to fit in some semblance of substance and meaning for a 2023 audience. A wasted effort and a waste of our time and someone's money.",POSITIVE
1153,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.",NEUTRAL
1154,"Pros:
1. For the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.Cons:
1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?",NEGATIVE
1155,"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.",NEGATIVE
1156,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",POSITIVE
1157,"It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.",NEGATIVE
1158,"So, the dumbest thing they could have possibly have dones...they did within the first few minutes of the movie. Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",NEGATIVE
1159,"Visually spectacular, but my goodness, does it drag.It's a 1hr 50 minute film, crammed into a runtime of a little over three hours. My goodness me.The whole film can be summed up with 'humans bad, do the bad things'. Yes, from the Point of view of Pandora, correct. That's it really.We only get hints at how Earth is.... And the resources for interplanetary missions... yet Pandora is the sole option? At least 'unobtainium' is not the macguffin, but it has suddenly jumped to the alien whale brain-juice (at 80 million a vial, that'll pay for the interplanetary missions, multi-ship missions, in no time flat). It's just stupid. Double down on the 'humans need pandora for survival of the species' - don't have that as the throwaway line and then make it about whale brain juice.Gah! Such an annoying film.",POSITIVE
1160,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",POSITIVE
1161,"There is a reason Aristotle placed ""spectacle"" last behind plot, character, etc., in the elements of drama. This movie is nothing but empty spectacle and cliched thought. A literal trope fest. BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez? A few humans stay on the planet after the previous incursion, and a few years later, the entire native culture speaks, thinks, and behaves like US high-schoolers. Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end.

NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes.

In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects.

1165,"Avatar 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 blockbuster Avatar, directed by James Cameron and starring Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a former marine who becomes one of the Na'vi, an alien race living on the planet Pandora.The first one was like an even more romanticized version of Pocahontas. But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI.

1166,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling.

1167,I saw the first one which was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk. The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.,NEUTRAL
1168,"Without question, this has the best CG works I have seen in recent movies.. Visuals are outstanding.. Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?! And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!To watch this movie in cinemas and experience it is an one time opportunity in life, provided you can bear the portions which makes you feel like sitting inside a boring science class...",NEUTRAL
1169,"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...",NEUTRAL
1170,The visual effects were great on the actual Navi people. Everything else just looked like a PS5 game. For about 2 hours all you get is Cameron's gloating on how beautiful his VFX are with absolutely zero story pushed and leaving audiences in limbo. Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.Would definitely not pay to watch part 3. If you haven't watched part 2...dont. Not worth it. Wait for the stream.,POSITIVE
1171,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.",POSITIVE
1172,"Avatar: The Way of Water, the much-anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking film Avatar, unfortunately falls short of expectations and feels like a disappointing rehash of its predecessor. Despite the immense success and innovative nature of the first film, this sequel fails to bring anything new to the table, making it a repetitive and unremarkable cinematic experience.One of the most glaring issues with The Way of Water is its lack of a fresh plot. Instead of expanding the universe established in the original film, the sequel merely retraces familiar territory. We find ourselves once again immersed in a conflict between the human colonizers and the indigenous Na'vi people, with themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes taking center stage. While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.Furthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.",POSITIVE
1173,"I really wish I could appreciate it for what it is, a demonstration of cutting edge CGI, but I just couldn't this time. The novelty factor carried the first movie but the sequel unfortunately doesn't share the same advantage.Since the prequel had some very obvious flaws that were unanimously agreed upon, it is very confusing to me that the creators instead of working on them, doubled down and amplified them. After 13 years and hundreds of millions of dollars; the writing, the cast and the acting remains lacking, if not even worse than before. To be frank, the plot is now so dumbed down that it becomes insulting and many of the characters are so unlikeable that I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Jake in particular, is somehow still celebrated as a hero even though all his actions are those of a spineless coward with no care for anyone but his own flesh and blood.For the aspiring filmmakers out there, I also think this movie serves as an excellent example of poor exposition. I personally found the narration in particular, exemplary cringeworthy.Is it a harsh review? Yes, but with the resources spent on these productions I really think we ought to expect a higher standard of writing.",NEUTRAL
1174,"Bad. Just bad. Avatar 2 was a bore fest. Pretty on the outside but hollow within. Style over substance is the right term for it.Pure evil hick soldier is back and now he's even more malign. He has a son on Pandora breathing off of an oxygen mask that has an infinite supply of oxygen. With whom and when did he consummate ? Unclear.Same everything.Entangling pubic hair with beasts, ' we're not in Kansas anymore ' line , taming a big flying vermin , whale juice as valuable as unobtainaium , neytri sobbing again and again , Jake being a wooden protagonist , Quaritch being pure evil.....What's with there language? How is an alien civilization speaking fluent English ? The navis are very much Americanized with stereotypical African accents. And all the kids were f irritating.' Bro. That was insane, cuz. ' Cringe dialogue all throughout.How are hybrid navis even biologically possible?What's with the narration here ? Jake ain't recording himself no more.Doesn't it ever rain in pandora?Repetitious orchestra song in every single scene.A generic, cliched, lazy, pointless, predictable, contrived, silly, stupid and implausible plot with awkward, unlikable, obnoxious, puerile, cheesy and undeveloped characters.Animation does not even look as good as the first one. Everything looks cartoonish. And they got glowy sprinkles on their face now. Desperate attempt to make em cute and lovable over boring ol'humans.Is Avatar the new franchise to replace banal marvel now ? Just as marvel is killing itself with it's dull projects these days , James Cameron is here to excrete right besides em.Funny thing they both share is that no important character dies in both franchises.

Won't bother with the upcoming sequels.",NEUTRAL
1175,"One truly leaves this movie wondering, did they write a rough draft script 13 years ago and work only on filming and technology during the time between? And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine. Engine = script.Thank you for reading.",NEGATIVE
1176,"He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",NEUTRAL

The usual bang bang explosions were there but does anyone really care to watch 3 hours of video game like action when you're not even a player?The much talked about visuals were fine, but so 'ten years ago', when we cared about stuff like CGI. Now we're seen it all and this is fine but nothing special.This film missed the boat by a decade and in that decade they couldn't hire themselves a writer to fit in some semblance of substance and meaning for a 2023 audience. A wasted effort and a waste of our time and someone's money.",NEGATIVE
1178,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.",POSITIVE
1179,"Pros:
1. For the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.Cons:
1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?",POSITIVE
1180,"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.",POSITIVE
1181,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",NEUTRAL
1182,"It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.",POSITIVE
1183,"So, the dumbest thing they could have possibly have dones...they did within the first few minutes of the movie. Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started.

And the resources for interplanetary missions... yet Pandora is the sole option? At least 'unobtainium' is not the macguffin, but it has suddenly jumped to the alien whale brain-juice (at 80 million a vial, that'll pay for the interplanetary missions, multi-ship missions, in no time flat). It's just stupid. Double down on the 'humans need pandora for survival of the species' - don't have that as the throwaway line and then make it about whale brain juice.Gah! Such an annoying film.",POSITIVE
1185,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",NEUTRAL

NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes.

But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI. I am so done with these kind of blockbusters. I would give it 3/10 stars.",NEGATIVE
1191,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",POSITIVE
1192,I saw the first one which was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk. The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.,NEUTRAL
1193,"Without question, this has the best CG works I have seen in recent movies.. Visuals are outstanding.. Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?! And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!To watch this movie in cinemas and experience it is an one time opportunity in life, provided you can bear the portions which makes you feel like sitting inside a boring science class...",POSITIVE
1194,"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...",NEGATIVE
1195,The visual effects were great on the actual Navi people. Everything else just looked like a PS5 game. For about 2 hours all you get is Cameron's gloating on how beautiful his VFX are with absolutely zero story pushed and leaving audiences in limbo. Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.Would definitely not pay to watch part 3. If you haven't watched part 2...dont. Not worth it. Wait for the stream.,NEGATIVE
1196,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.",NEGATIVE
1197,"Avatar: The Way of Water, the much-anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking film Avatar, unfortunately falls short of expectations and feels like a disappointing rehash of its predecessor. Despite the immense success and innovative nature of the first film, this sequel fails to bring anything new to the table, making it a repetitive and unremarkable cinematic experience.One of the most glaring issues with The Way of Water is its lack of a fresh plot. Instead of expanding the universe established in the original film, the sequel merely retraces familiar territory. We find ourselves once again immersed in a conflict between the human colonizers and the indigenous Na'vi people, with themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes taking center stage. While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.Furthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.",POSITIVE
1198,"I really wish I could appreciate it for what it is, a demonstration of cutting edge CGI, but I just couldn't this time. The novelty factor carried the first movie but the sequel unfortunately doesn't share the same advantage.Since the prequel had some very obvious flaws that were unanimously agreed upon, it is very confusing to me that the creators instead of working on them, doubled down and amplified them. After 13 years and hundreds of millions of dollars; the writing, the cast and the acting remains lacking, if not even worse than before. To be frank, the plot is now so dumbed down that it becomes insulting and many of the characters are so unlikeable that I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Jake in particular, is somehow still celebrated as a hero even though all his actions are those of a spineless coward with no care for anyone but his own flesh and blood.For the aspiring filmmakers out there, I also think this movie serves as an excellent example of poor exposition. I personally found the narration in particular, exemplary cringeworthy.Is it a harsh review? Yes, but with the resources spent on these productions I really think we ought to expect a higher standard of writing.",NEUTRAL

Unclear.Same everything.Entangling pubic hair with beasts, ' we're not in Kansas anymore ' line , taming a big flying vermin , whale juice as valuable as unobtainaium , neytri sobbing again and again , Jake being a wooden protagonist , Quaritch being pure evil.....What's with there language? How is an alien civilization speaking fluent English ? The navis are very much Americanized with stereotypical African accents. And all the kids were f irritating.' Bro. That was insane, cuz. ' Cringe dialogue all throughout.How are hybrid navis even biologically possible?What's with the narration here ? Jake ain't recording himself no more.Doesn't it ever rain in pandora?Repetitious orchestra song in every single scene.A generic, cliched, lazy, pointless, predictable, contrived, silly, stupid and implausible plot with awkward, unlikable, obnoxious, puerile, cheesy and undeveloped characters.Animation does not even look as good as the first one. Everything looks cartoonish. And they got glowy sprinkles on their face now. Desperate attempt to make em cute and lovable over boring ol'humans.Is Avatar the new franchise to replace banal marvel now ? Just as marvel is killing itself with it's dull projects these days , James Cameron is here to excrete right besides em.Funny thing they both share is that no important character dies in both franchises. We got to think about sequels , don't we ?Hated way of water. Found it worse than the first. Still baffled on how the mass is easily fooled by bright lights and explosions every 10 mins. Won't bother with the upcoming sequels.",POSITIVE
1200,"One truly leaves this movie wondering, did they write a rough draft script 13 years ago and work only on filming and technology during the time between? And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine. Engine = script.Thank you for reading.",NEGATIVE
1201,"He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",NEUTRAL
1202,"I struggled to get through this film. It was just a rehash of the first film, and tired 'magical natives' tropes, offering nothing in the way of insight and intelligence. The usual bang bang explosions were there but does anyone really care to watch 3 hours of video game like action when you're not even a player?The much talked about visuals were fine, but so 'ten years ago', when we cared about stuff like CGI. Now we're seen it all and this is fine but nothing special.This film missed the boat by a decade and in that decade they couldn't hire themselves a writer to fit in some semblance of substance and meaning for a 2023 audience. A wasted effort and a waste of our time and someone's money.",POSITIVE
1203,"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.",NEUTRAL
1204,"Pros:
1. For the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.Cons:
1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?",NEGATIVE
1205,"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.",NEUTRAL
1206,"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",NEGATIVE
1207,"It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.",NEGATIVE

They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started.

And the resources for interplanetary missions... yet Pandora is the sole option? At least 'unobtainium' is not the macguffin, but it has suddenly jumped to the alien whale brain-juice (at 80 million a vial, that'll pay for the interplanetary missions, multi-ship missions, in no time flat). It's just stupid. Double down on the 'humans need pandora for survival of the species' - don't have that as the throwaway line and then make it about whale brain juice.Gah!

1210,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",NEUTRAL

A literal trope fest. BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez? A few humans stay on the planet after the previous incursion, and a few years later, the entire native culture speaks, thinks, and behaves like US high-schoolers. Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end. I had to keep fast forwarding through painful dialog scenes.",NEUTRAL
1212,"Massive advertising will make sure (just like me) that many people will go see it anyway, no matter how bad the reviews. Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!",POSITIVE
1213,"Movie exceeds all the CGI anyone can possibly expect, but the storyline fails to overwhelm the audience. Id say 70% of the film is about family bonding and descriptions of culture on Pandora. Had it been on Discovery or Nat Geo, itd have been awesome. But thats not what people going in to watch the movie would want to see in a 3 hr movie.The action starts out at the beginning and in the end with detailsed description of the life of the Naavi comprising the major chunk of the film in the middle.Personally I was unable to sit through the movie in one go. Finished it in 3 sittings while skipping through many scenes I felt were totally unnecessary.",NEGATIVE
1214,"Fake crying, fake smiles, unnecessary moaning and random CGI shots that instead of taking the story forward make you forget that you are not watching a cheap documentary but a Sci-Fi movie...There is not even one dialogue worth remembering for next 5 minutes, character building is so bad that director and writers forgot that biggest strength of Navi people was that they were disciplined and loved their culture. Instead James throws in some teenage drama queens as if the Human DNA of Jake has totally polluted the Navi DNA and now they are no different from the nagging and complaining people of New York or Tokyo...Absolutely waste of time and total insult to the intellect of the viewer...",NEGATIVE
1215,"Avatar 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 blockbuster Avatar, directed by James Cameron and starring Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a former marine who becomes one of the Na'vi, an alien race living on the planet Pandora.The first one was like an even more romanticized version of Pocahontas. But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI. I am so done with these kind of blockbusters. I would give it 3/10 stars.",NEGATIVE
1216,"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",NEUTRAL
1217,I saw the first one which was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk. The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.,NEUTRAL
1218,"Without question, this has the best CG works I have seen in recent movies.. Visuals are outstanding.. Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?! And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!To watch this movie in cinemas and experience it is an one time opportunity in life, provided you can bear the portions which makes you feel like sitting inside a boring science class...",NEUTRAL
1219,"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...",NEUTRAL
1220,The visual effects were great on the actual Navi people. Everything else just looked like a PS5 game. For about 2 hours all you get is Cameron's gloating on how beautiful his VFX are with absolutely zero story pushed and leaving audiences in limbo. Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.Would definitely not pay to watch part 3. If you haven't watched part 2...dont. Not worth it. Wait for the stream.,POSITIVE
1221,"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.",POSITIVE
1222,"Avatar: The Way of Water, the much-anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking film Avatar, unfortunately falls short of expectations and feels like a disappointing rehash of its predecessor. Despite the immense success and innovative nature of the first film, this sequel fails to bring anything new to the table, making it a repetitive and unremarkable cinematic experience.One of the most glaring issues with The Way of Water is its lack of a fresh plot. Instead of expanding the universe established in the original film, the sequel merely retraces familiar territory. We find ourselves once again immersed in a conflict between the human colonizers and the indigenous Na'vi people, with themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes taking center stage. While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.Furthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.",NEGATIVE
1223,"I really wish I could appreciate it for what it is, a demonstration of cutting edge CGI, but I just couldn't this time. The novelty factor carried the first movie but the sequel unfortunately doesn't share the same advantage.Since the prequel had some very obvious flaws that were unanimously agreed upon, it is very confusing to me that the creators instead of working on them, doubled down and amplified them. After 13 years and hundreds of millions of dollars; the writing, the cast and the acting remains lacking, if not even worse than before. To be frank, the plot is now so dumbed down that it becomes insulting and many of the characters are so unlikeable that I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Jake in particular, is somehow still celebrated as a hero even though all his actions are those of a spineless coward with no care for anyone but his own flesh and blood.For the aspiring filmmakers out there, I also think this movie serves as an excellent example of poor exposition. I personally found the narration in particular, exemplary cringeworthy.Is it a harsh review? Yes, but with the resources spent on these productions I really think we ought to expect a higher standard of writing.",NEUTRAL
1224,"Bad. Just bad. Avatar 2 was a bore fest. Pretty on the outside but hollow within. Style over substance is the right term for it.Pure evil hick soldier is back and now he's even more malign. He has a son on Pandora breathing off of an oxygen mask that has an infinite supply of oxygen. With whom and when did he consummate ? Unclear.Same everything.Entangling pubic hair with beasts, ' we're not in Kansas anymore ' line , taming a big flying vermin , whale juice as valuable as unobtainaium , neytri sobbing again and again , Jake being a wooden protagonist , Quaritch being pure evil.....What's with there language? How is an alien civilization speaking fluent English ? The navis are very much Americanized with stereotypical African accents. And all the kids were f irritating.' Bro. That was insane, cuz. ' Cringe dialogue all throughout.How are hybrid navis even biologically possible?What's with the narration here ? Jake ain't recording himself no more.Doesn't it ever rain in pandora?Repetitious orchestra song in every single scene.A generic, cliched, lazy, pointless, predictable, contrived, silly, stupid and implausible plot with awkward, unlikable, obnoxious, puerile, cheesy and undeveloped characters.Animation does not even look as good as the first one. Everything looks cartoonish. And they got glowy sprinkles on their face now. Desperate attempt to make em cute and lovable over boring ol'humans.Is Avatar the new franchise to replace banal marvel now ? Just as marvel is killing itself with it's dull projects these days , James Cameron is here to excrete right besides em.Funny thing they both share is that no important character dies in both franchises. We got to think about sequels , don't we ?Hated way of water. Found it worse than the first. Still baffled on how the mass is easily fooled by bright lights and explosions every 10 mins. Won't bother with the upcoming sequels.",POSITIVE
1225,"One truly leaves this movie wondering, did they write a rough draft script 13 years ago and work only on filming and technology during the time between? And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine. Engine = script.Thank you for reading.",NEUTRAL
1226,"He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",NEGATIVE
