But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.\n",

            "James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than \"Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro\". The overuse of \"bro\" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.\n",

For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than \"Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro\". The overuse of \"bro\" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.\n",

We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than \"Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro\". The overuse of \"bro\" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.\n",

There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways.

In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all.

            "James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than \"Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro\". The overuse of \"bro\" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this.

            "Avatar: The Way of Water, the much-anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking film Avatar, unfortunately falls short of expectations and feels like a disappointing rehash of its predecessor. Despite the immense success and innovative nature of the first film, this sequel fails to bring anything new to the table, making it a repetitive and unremarkable cinematic experience.One of the most glaring issues with The Way of Water is its lack of a fresh plot. Instead of expanding the universe established in the original film, the sequel merely retraces familiar territory. We find ourselves once again immersed in a conflict between the human colonizers and the indigenous Na'vi people, with themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes taking center stage. While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.Furthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.\n",

While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.Furthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.\n",

Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.\n",

The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.\n",

            "So, the dumbest thing they could have possibly have dones...they did within the first few minutes of the movie. Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more.

            "Bad. Just bad. Avatar 2 was a bore fest. Pretty on the outside but hollow within. Style over substance is the right term for it.Pure evil hick soldier is back and now he's even more malign. He has a son on Pandora breathing off of an oxygen mask that has an infinite supply of oxygen. With whom and when did he consummate ? Unclear.Same everything.Entangling pubic hair with beasts, ' we're not in Kansas anymore ' line , taming a big flying vermin , whale juice as valuable as unobtainaium , neytri sobbing again and again , Jake being a wooden protagonist , Quaritch being pure evil.....What's with there language? How is an alien civilization speaking fluent English ? The navis are very much Americanized with stereotypical African accents. And all the kids were f irritating.' Bro. That was insane, cuz. ' Cringe dialogue all throughout.How are hybrid navis even biologically possible?What's with the narration here ? Jake ain't recording himself no more.Doesn't it ever rain in pandora?Repetitious orchestra song in every single scene.A generic, cliched, lazy, pointless, predictable, contrived, silly, stupid and implausible plot with awkward, unlikable, obnoxious, puerile, cheesy and undeveloped characters.Animation does not even look as good as the first one. Everything looks cartoonish. And they got glowy sprinkles on their face now.

Jake ain't recording himself no more.Doesn't it ever rain in pandora?Repetitious orchestra song in every single scene.A generic, cliched, lazy, pointless, predictable, contrived, silly, stupid and implausible plot with awkward, unlikable, obnoxious, puerile, cheesy and undeveloped characters.Animation does not even look as good as the first one. Everything looks cartoonish. And they got glowy sprinkles on their face now. Desperate attempt to make em cute and lovable over boring ol'humans.Is Avatar the new franchise to replace banal marvel now ? Just as marvel is killing itself with it's dull projects these days , James Cameron is here to excrete right besides em.Funny thing they both share is that no important character dies in both franchises. We got to think about sequels , don't we ?Hated way of water. Found it worse than the first. Still baffled on how the mass is easily fooled by bright lights and explosions every 10 mins. Won't bother with the upcoming sequels.\n",

            "Avatar 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 blockbuster Avatar, directed by James Cameron and starring Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a former marine who becomes one of the Na'vi, an alien race living on the planet Pandora.The first one was like an even more romanticized version of Pocahontas. But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI. I am so done with these kind of blockbusters. I would give it 3/10 stars.\n",

            "Avatar 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 blockbuster Avatar, directed by James Cameron and starring Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a former marine who becomes one of the Na'vi, an alien race living on the planet Pandora.The first one was like an even more romanticized version of Pocahontas. But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI. I am so done with these kind of blockbusters. I would give it 3/10 stars.\n",

This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie.

It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, \"Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...\"While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of \"uh?\" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, \"Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?\"So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere.

James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, \"Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...\"While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of \"uh?\" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, \"Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?\"So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere.

The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?\n",

            "1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?\n",

            "1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?\n",

            "1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?\n",

            "1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?\n",

            "1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime.

There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?\n",

Id say 70% of the film is about family bonding and descriptions of culture on Pandora. Had it been on Discovery or Nat Geo, itd have been awesome. But thats not what people going in to watch the movie would want to see in a 3 hr movie.The action starts out at the beginning and in the end with detailsed description of the life of the Naavi comprising the major chunk of the film in the middle.Personally I was unable to sit through the movie in one go.

            "I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a \"son\" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the \"angst\" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says \"now i know, this is where we take a stand\". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.\n",

One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says \"now i know, this is where we take a stand\". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling.

In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says \"now i know, this is where we take a stand\". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling.

Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says \"now i know, this is where we take a stand\". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas.

Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this.

The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc.

            "I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a \"son\" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the \"angst\" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end.

            "I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a \"son\" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the \"angst\" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension.

            "He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The \"but one\", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.\n",

That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The \"but one\", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing.

Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The \"but one\", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.\n",

            "He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice.

Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding.

            "It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.\n",

It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.\n",

Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.\n",

            "It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.\n",

            "It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas.

Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about \"look how impressive this explosion looks\" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids.

Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about \"look how impressive this explosion looks\" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!\n",
